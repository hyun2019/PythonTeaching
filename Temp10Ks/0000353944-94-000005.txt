ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

General

     International Game Technology (the "Company") was incorporated in
December 1980 to acquire the gaming licensee and operating entity, IGT
(recently renamed IGT-North America), and facilitate the Company's initial
public offering.  In addition to its 100% ownership of IGT-North America,
the Company directly or indirectly owns 100% of IGT-International, ("IGT-
International"), 100% of IGT-Australia, Pty. Ltd. ("IGT-Australia"), 100%
of IGT-Europe b.v. ("IGT-Europe"), 99.75% of IGT-Iceland Ltd. ("IGT-
Iceland") and 100% of IGT-Japan k.k. ("IGT-Japan").  In December 1993 the
Company sold its interest in its riverboat partnerships and on September
30, 1993 sold its interest in CMS-International ("CMS"). See "Discontinued
Operations."

     IGT-North America is the largest manufacturer of computerized casino
gaming products and proprietary systems in the world.  The Company believes
it manufactures the broadest range of microprocessor-based gaming machines
available.  The Company also develops and manufactures "SMART" systems
which monitor slot machine play and track player activity.  In addition to
gaming product sales and leases, the Company has developed and sells
computerized linked proprietary systems to monitor video gaming terminals
and has developed specialized video gaming terminals for lotteries and
other applications.  IGT-North America also develops and operates
proprietary software linked progressive systems.  The Company derives
revenues related to the operations of these systems as well as collects
license and franchise fees for the use of the systems.  

     IGT-International was established in September 1993 to oversee all
operations outside of North America by the Company's foreign subsidiaries. 
IGT-International also conducts sales either directly or through
distributors in countries not served by the Company's foreign subsidiaries.

     IGT-Australia, located in Sydney, Australia, manufactures
microprocessor-based gaming products and proprietary systems, and performs
engineering, manufacturing, sales and marketing and distribution operations
for the Australian markets as well as other gaming jurisdictions in the
Southern Hemisphere and Pacific Rim.

     IGT-Europe was established in The Netherlands in February 1992 to
distribute and market gaming products in Eastern and Western Europe and
Africa.  Prior to providing direct sales, the Company sold its products in
these markets through a distributor.  

     IGT-Iceland was established in September 1993 to provide system
software, machines, equipment and technical assistance to support Iceland's
video lottery operations.

     IGT-Japan was established in July 1990, and in November 1992 opened an
office in Tokyo, Japan.  On April 16, 1993, IGT-Japan was approved to
supply Pachisuro gaming machines to the Japanese market, and the Company
began delivery of these machines during the third quarter of fiscal 1993.

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

Discontinued Operations

     During fiscal 1993, the Company divested its investments in casino
operations through the sale of its interest in the President Riverboat
Casinos, Inc. ("PRC") and CMS.  These dispositions were made as part of the
Company's strategy to focus on its core businesses of manufacturing
machines and the development of proprietary systems software.  

     Iowa Riverboat Corporation ("IRC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
 Company, established in March 1990, was a 40% partner in an Iowa
partnership that owned and operated the President riverboat casino and the
Blackhawk Hotel in Davenport, Iowa.  International Acceptance Corporation
("IAC"), also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owned 45% of a
riverboat excursion operation and the permanently docked Admiral riverboat
in St. Louis, Missouri.  In December 1992, the Company contributed the
assets of IRC and IAC to PRC in exchange for 1,671,429 shares of PRC common
stock.  These shares were subsequently sold to the public as part of an
initial public offering of PRC common stock on December 17, 1992 (see Note
12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

     CMS, established in August 1988, operated casinos and hotel/casinos
for the Company including the Silver Club hotel and casino and The Treasury
Club casino in Sparks, Nevada, the El Capitan Club in Hawthorne, Nevada and
the King's Casino on the island of Antigua in the Caribbean.  Effective
September 30, 1993, the Company sold its ownership interest in CMS. 

     Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to "International
Game Technology", "IGT" or the "Company" include International Game
Technology and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and their subsidiaries.  The
principal executive offices of the Company are located at 520 South Rock
Boulevard, Reno, Nevada  89502; its telephone number is (702) 688-0100. 

     The following table shows the revenues, operating results and
identifiable assets for the continuing operations of the Company's two
principal lines of business.

Gaming Products

     Products

     The Company develops its gaming products for two major markets: the
traditional casino gaming market and the government sponsored video gaming
terminal market.   During 1993, the Company also began producing pachisuro
machines, a Japanese style slot machine.

     The Company was the first to develop computerized video gaming and
today, under the Players Edge Plus trademark, the Company sells a variety
of different games.  The games include the video poker and "blackjack"
products in the upright, slant-top and drop-in bar models.  The Players
Edge Plus line is also available in slant-top keno, dual screen keno and
large screen video poker and video slots.  Players Edge Plus machines offer
player appeal and security including multilevel progressives, embedded and
side-mount bill acceptors, enhanced sound packages, embedded progressive
meters and data communication devices.

     The Company also offers a complete line of spinning reel slot
machines sold under the trademark S-Plus.   The S-Plus series slot machines
use an advanced microprocessor system that accommodates several progressive
link configurations, enhanced audit trail functions, selection of game
software and optional side-mount or embedded bill acceptors.  S-Plus
machines run existing S-slot programs or the latest partitioned software
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

which facilitates program updates.  A game change can occur quickly by
selecting a new program chip from IGT's extensive game library and by
changing the glass and reel strips.  The S-Plus machines are manufactured
in various sizes and colors and are offered in several designs including
upright, slant top and drop-in-bar.

     IGT-North America also develops, manufactures and markets
microprocessor based Slot Marketing and Revenue Tracking "SMART" systems. 
The SMART computer system identifies frequent players, records playing
history, provides direct marketing information, automates slot accounting
and provides additional security to casino customers.  IGT provides SMART
system 24-hour technical support and a software maintenance agreement for
on-site service by specially trained system engineers.  

     Over the past decade, advancements in gaming machine technology have
attracted a greater number of players to slot and video machines due
primarily to higher jackpots and enhanced player appeal.  These
improvements have significantly influenced casino gaming revenues. 
Generally, annual slot and video revenues of domestic casinos exceed
revenues from table games.

     The Company's innovations in slot and video technology have increased
the machines' earning potential by improving the ease and speed of play,
and by decreasing down-time through improved reliability and added service
features.  All new gaming machines offer a wide variety of games,
innovative designs, sophisticated security features, self-diagnostic
capabilities, and various accounting and data retention functions.  The
Company's engineering and design staff continually provide technological
improvements and ongoing game development.  The Company has  obtained
numerous patents on various aspects of the video and reel-type gaming
machines and systems.  The visual aspects of the product are upgraded and
customized by the Company's graphic design and silkscreen departments. 

     The Company manufactures and markets video gaming terminals ("VGTs")
for government sponsored gaming programs.  The VGTs are similar to the
Company's video gaming machines, although the wagering and payment of
jackpots differ.  After inserting money in a VGT, the player is issued
credit and plays the machine like a traditional video machine.  Player
losses are deducted from the credit and winnings are added, instead of
coins being dropped into a tray.  Upon completion of play, the VGT prints
out a ticket showing the remaining amount of credit, and the ticket is
redeemable for cash.  Unlike traditional gaming machines, VGTs are
typically linked to a central computer for accounting and security
purposes, which is monitored by the state lotteries or other government
agencies.

     The following schedule illustrates revenues derived from the sale of
gaming products for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992.

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

     Markets

     The Company markets its gaming products in North America and in
jurisdictions throughout the world.  The largest established North American
markets are Nevada and Atlantic City.  The Company estimates that it
manufactured approximately 10,700 of the estimated 24,000 gaming machines
currently in place in Atlantic City.  Nevada is both the oldest and largest
market for the Company's products with an installed base of approximately
160,000 machines.  The Company estimates it manufactured approximately
140,000 of the total machines currently in use in Nevada.

     Within Nevada, there has been increased demand for the Company's
products attributable to the construction of new casinos and the
refurbishment of existing casinos.  The increased demand began with the
opening of the Mirage hotel and casino in 1989 and the Excalibur hotel and
casino in 1990.  In fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992, the Company's sales volume
in Nevada increased due to additional casino expansions and the replacement
of older machines with new games, designs and technological advancements. 
During calendar 1993, three additional new major properties began operating
in Nevada.  These are the Luxor, Treasure Island and the MGM Grand.  These
three hotel casinos added more than 8,000 gaming machines or approximately
5% to the installed base of gaming machines in Nevada, and of these
machines approximately 6,500 were manufactured by the Company.  The market
for the Company's products in Nevada will continue to grow in the event
casino expansions and refurbishment continue.  In addition, the
construction of new casinos has increased competitive pressures for casino
operators to replace existing machines with new or upgraded machines.  

     Product sales outside of Nevada and New Jersey exceeded 70% of sales
during fiscal 1993 as gaming spread to new jurisdictions in North America.
These new jurisdictions include "limited stakes" gaming in the western
United States, riverboats, Indian gaming and government-sponsored video and
slot gaming.

     Riverboat gaming began in Iowa during 1991 and as of September 30,
1993 was operating in three states: Iowa, Illinois and Mississippi. 
Riverboat gaming is also legal in Louisiana, Missouri, and Indiana although
not yet operational at the end of fiscal year 1993.  Additionally,
riverboat legislation is under consideration in Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. At the end of
fiscal year 1993, the riverboat installed base approximated 16,000 gaming
machines operating on 24 riverboats in three states.  IGT estimates that it
manufactured more than 13,000 of these machines.  

     Casino-style gaming continues to expand on American Indian lands. 
Indian gaming is regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988
which permits specific types of gaming.  Pursuant to these regulations,
permissible gaming devices are denoted as "Class III Gaming" which
requires, as a condition to implementation, that the Indian tribe and the
state government in which the Indian lands are located enter into a compact
governing the terms of the proposed gaming.  IGT machines are placed only
with Indian gaming operators who have negotiated a compact with the state
and received approval by the U. S. Department of the Interior.   The
Company, through its distributor Sodak Gaming, Inc., began selling machines
to authorized Indian casinos in 1990. The Company has either directly or
through its distributor sold machines in the following 10 states:  
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.  Compacts have also been approved in
Mississippi, Michigan and Oregon, although no deliveries were made in these
jurisdictions during fiscal 1993.  In addition to the approved states,
Class III compacts are under consideration in several states including
Alabama, California, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Texas
and Washington.  The installed base of Indian gaming machines at September
30, 1993 was approximately 26,000 units, and the Company estimates it
manufactured 19,500 of these machines.

     Government-sponsored gaming in North America also creates a market for
the Company's video and slot products.  The Company's video gaming
terminals are currently operational in Louisiana, Oregon Rhode Island,
South Dakota and the Canadian Provinces of Manitoba, New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  The Company supplied
the central computer systems for government sponsored gaming in Manitoba,
Oregon and Louisiana and estimates that it manufactured approximately
12,500 of the approximately 50,000 video gaming terminals installed.  The
Province of Quebec recently legalized video gaming terminals with an
estimated start up in the first half of calendar year 1994.

     In addition to video terminal gaming, various Canadian governments
recently approved slot and video gaming in casino environments.  The
Province of Manitoba opened two casino style entertainment centers during
September 1993 with approximately 600 slot machines of which the Company
supplied 540.  The Province of Quebec began casino-style gaming in Montreal
during October 1993, and the Company supplied 480 of the 1,200 units
initially installed.  Quebec has plans at this time for three additional
casinos.  A casino is also planned for Windsor, Ontario, with a scheduled
opening date of early 1994.  Casino gaming will commence there in a
temporary facility housing 1,600 slot machines, with the permanent facility
scheduled for a 1996 start up.  

     In addition to the traditional and emerging U. S. markets, gaming is
also expanding in the Company's international markets.  Australia is the
most important market for the Company's gaming machine products outside of
North America.  The State of New South Wales is the second largest market
in the world for the Company's gaming machines with an estimated total of
68,000 machines in 2,100 pubs and 1,500 clubs.  The Company began selling
machines in Australia in 1986 and has supplied approximately 13,000 of the
machines in New South Wales.  In 1991, the State of Queensland legalized
the operation of gaming machines in private pubs and clubs.  The State of
Queensland awarded the Company a contract to provide the central computer
system linking the machines for accounting and security purposes.  The
central computer system was installed and accepted in October 1991 and
gaming commenced in February 1992.  The Company estimates that it supplied
5,300 machines or 38% of the 14,000 total machines.  Gaming began in the
State of Victoria during July 1992 using two separate central systems.  The
systems are operated by competing agencies that are each allowed to place
up to 10,000 machines.  South Australia legalized gaming in September of
1992, but it has not yet been implemented.  Other Australian jurisdictions
are considering the legalization or expansion of gaming operations and New
South Wales is considering the expansion of its gaming operation.

     The Company has had a direct sales presence in Europe since February
1992.  Since that time, increasing customer awareness of product

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

availability, combined with service and training assistance, has
contributed to improved sales.  There have been previous sales in Western
Europe with recent activity in France, Austria, Switzerland and The
Netherlands.  Central Europe sales have been made primarily in Turkey,
Slovenia and Poland.  

     IGT-International completed an agreement in fiscal 1993 with the
University of Iceland Lottery, ("UIL") whereby the Company will supply
video lottery terminals and a central system linking the video lottery
terminals.  The central system incorporates a progressive jackpot feature. 
The Iceland system, managed by the UIL, began operating in December 1993
with 350 video lottery terminals manufactured by the Company.

     The Companys Pachisuro machine was approved in April 1993 for sale in
Japan by the Japanese technical testing laboratory (Security Electronics
and Communications Technology Association).  The machine market in Japan
consists of 3,000,000 Pachinko machines and 800,000 Pachisuro machines
which operate in Pachinko parlors throughout the country of Japan.  IGT is
the first U.S. company authorized to supply Pachisuro machines and will
compete with approximately 20 Japan-based companies that currently supply
this market.

Gaming Operations 

     Proprietary Systems

     The Company developed and introduced the world's first electronically-
linked, inter-casino proprietary gaming machine system in 1986.  These
systems link gaming machines in various casinos to a central computer.  The
systems build a large "progressive" jackpot which increases with every
wager made throughout the system.  The systems are designed to increase
gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving players the
opportunity to win jackpots substantially larger than those available from
gaming machines which are not linked to a progressive system.  The
following are linked progressive systems developed by the Company:

     *    In Nevada, five systems under the names Megabucks, Quartermania,
          Nevada Nickels, Fabulous Fifties, and High Rollers are operated
          by the Company.  Of the total 3,600 gaming machines linked to
          these systems, approximately 1,800 are owned by the Company and
          approximately 1,800 are owned by casinos.

     *    In Atlantic City, New Jersey, seven  systems under the names
          Megabucks, Quartermania, Fabulous Fifties, High Rollers,
          Progressive "21", Megapoker and Pokermania are operated by a
          trust managed by representatives from participating casinos.  The
          Company owns all of the approximately 1,200 machines linked to
          these progressive systems.

     *    In Mississippi, four systems under the names Megabucks,
          Quartermania, Fabulous Fifties and Mississippi Nickels are
          operated by the Company.   Approximately 230 machines are
          operated on these systems.  Two additional systems are expected
          to commence operations in Mississippi in early fiscal 1994: 
          Pokermania and High Rollers.

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

     *    Other systems include a Megabucks system in Macau which consists
          of approximately 180 machines owned by the casinos; a
          Quartermania system in Colorado linking 156 machines owned by the
          casinos; and a Deadwood, South Dakota Quartermania system which
          includes approximately 60 casino-owned machines.  A Colorado
          Megabucks and Colorado Nickels system are planned for
          installation in the second fiscal quarter of 1994.

     The operation of linked progressive systems varies between
jurisdictions as a result of different gaming regulations.  In Nevada,
Mississippi and South Dakota, the casinos retain the net win, less a
percentage paid to the Company to fund the progressive jackpots.  These
jackpots are paid out in equal installments over a twenty year period.  The
Company also earns interest on these funds until jackpots are paid.  In
Atlantic City, the casinos retain the net win, less a percentage paid to a
trust managed by representatives of the participating casinos to fund the
jackpots and pay other system expenses.  The trust records a liability to
the Company for an annual casino licensing fee as well as an annual machine
rental fee for each machine.  In Colorado, the casinos retain the net win
less a percentage paid to a separate fund managed by the Company which pays
the jackpots.  Progressive system lease fees are paid to the Company from
this fund.  

     The Company also offers a "leased" link progressive system which links
gaming machines within a single casino or multiple casinos of common
ownership.  Currently four major hotel casinos operate such systems, with
from three to seven hotel casinos linked per system.  Approximately 420
gaming machines are linked between all such systems as of October 31, 1993.

     In September 1992, Rhode Island began operation of a video lottery
system linking approximately 850 video lottery terminals at two pari-mutuel
facilities.  As of September 30, 1993, an estimated 1,260 terminals were
operating on the system.  IGT, one of four manufacturers providing
terminals, has approximately 310 terminals installed on this system and
receives a percentage of the net win from its terminals.

     Video gaming in Oregon commenced in March of 1992, and IGT was awarded
the contract to supply the central computer system that currently links
approximately 6,000 terminals.  The Company currently leases approximately
1,750 machines to the Oregon State Lottery.

     Route and Lease Operations

     Until August 1992, the Company operated one of Nevada's largest route
operations, consisting of machines located in bars and taverns with the
Company responsible for the operation, servicing and collection of the
monies from these machines.  The location either shared the net win from
the gaming machines on a percentage basis or received a fee for rental of
space.  In August 1992, the Company sold all of its route equipment and
operating contracts which included approximately 1,380 gaming machines at
approximately 160 locations.

     On November 23, 1992, the Company sold all of the equipment and
operating contracts of the Megapoker route (a linked progressive system for
video poker machines located throughout the state of Nevada) as well as
licensing the purchaser to use, in Nevada, all Megapoker software, 
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

trademarks and trade names.  This transaction included approximately 280
gaming machines owned and operated by the Company at 62 locations.

     The Company leases gaming equipment to its customers and at September
30, 1993 leased approximately 4,000 gaming machines primarily in the
Colorado, Nevada and riverboat markets.

     In January 1993, the Company began operating approximately 180 gaming
machines at the Reno Cannon International Airport under a contract with the
Airport Authority.  The Airport Authority shares in the net win of the
machines with a minimum annual guaranteed amount.

Marketing

     The Company markets gaming products and proprietary systems through
its internal sales staff, agents and distributors.  The Company employs
more than 150 direct sales personnel in offices in several United States
locations as well as Canada, Australia and Europe.  The Company uses
distributors for sales to specific markets including Louisiana, South
Carolina, a Canadian maritime province, Atlantic City, the Caribbean,
France, Japan and North American Indian reservations.  The Company's
agreements with distributors do not specify minimum purchases but provide
that the Company may terminate the distribution agreement if certain
performance standards are not met.  

     The Company's marketing strategy is to offer its customers not only
the broadest product line but also ongoing game development.  IGT's game
library contains numerous game variations. Reprogramming machines for the
newest games and changing the glass design can be accomplished quickly. 

     In addition to offering an expansive product line, the Company
provides customized services in response to specific casino requests. 
These services include high quality silkscreen printing of gaming machine
glass, video graphics, customized game development and interior design
services.  IGT developed more than 20 new games which included a variety of
custom artwork for the Luxor and Treasure Island casinos that opened in
fiscal 1993 and the MGM casino that opened in fiscal 1994 in Las Vegas. 
The Company also offers customized design services that utilize computer
aided design and three-dimensional studio software programs.  The Company's
design department generates a casino floor layout and can create a proposed
casino slot mix for its customers.  The final design incorporates casino
colors, themes, signage, customer glass and includes either an overhead
floor plan layout, viewable from any angle, or a three-dimensional moving
walk-through of the casino.

     The Company also considers its customer service department an
important aspect of the overall marketing strategy.  The Company typically 
provides a 90 day service and parts warranty for its gaming machines and 
charges on a time and material basis thereafter.  The Company currently has
more than 300 trained service personnel and maintains service offices in
Australia, Canada, Colorado, Florida, Japan, Mississippi, Missouri,
Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Zealand and in The Netherlands.  The
Company also maintains a customer hot-line available 24-hours a day, seven
days a week to respond to customer questions.<PAGE>
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

     During fiscal 1993, the Company's ten largest customers accounted for
34% of its gaming product sales.  Sodak Gaming, the Company's principal
distributor of gaming products to American Indian reservations, was the
largest purchaser of the Company's products, accounting for 12.0% of total
product sales.  The Company believes the loss of this customer would not
have a long term material adverse effect on product sales of the Company as
other means of distribution to this market is available.  The
nature of the Company's business encompasses large initial orders of gaming
products upon the opening, expansion or renovation of a casino as well as
for the start-up of government sponsored video gaming operations. 
Subsequent orders from established customers result from remodeling or
expansion of existing facilities as well as replacement of machines due to
technological advancements, new designs and upgrades.  Sales of the
Company's products can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as new
jurisdictions throughout the world legalize gambling and new casinos in
established gaming markets are opened.  The Company believes that its
revenues from gaming product sales would not be materially affected by the
loss of any single customer.

Competition

     Product Sales

     The Company competes with substantial U.S. and foreign manufacturers. 
In the casino style gaming machine market, the primary competitors are
Bally Gaming International, Inc. ("Bally"), Sigma Game, Inc. ("Sigma"), and
Universal Distributing of Nevada, Inc. ("Universal").  Bally is a Nevada
company while Sigma and Universal are Japanese companies.  In the slot
management and revenue tracking market, the Company competes with Casino
Data Systems.  Competitors in the video gaming terminal market include
domestic and Japanese manufacturers, including three large domestic lottery
suppliers, G-Tech, Williams and Video Lottery Consultants.  G-Tech,
Williams and Video Lottery Consultants have an established presence in the
lottery market, substantial resources, and specialize in the development
and marketing of gaming terminals to governments.  

     Gaming Operations

     Competition in the progressive systems business is currently limited
but could increase in the future.

     Manufacturing and Suppliers

     The Company's manufacturing operations primarily involve assembly of
electronic and computer components, including chips, video monitors and 
prefabricated parts purchased from outside sources.  The Company does,
however, operate metal fabricating, custom wood cabinet manufacturing and
silkscreen facilities.  The Company is not dependent upon any one supplier
for any raw material.  The Company purchases certain components from
subcontractors and believes that alternative sources of these components
are available.  The Company believes its relations with its vendors are 
good.  The Company uses technical staff to assure quality control.  

     The Company generally carries a significant amount of inventory due to
the broad range of products it manufactures and to facilitate its capacity 
to fill customer orders on a timely basis.  In 1993, the Company's 

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

production of gaming machines increased approximately 17% resulting in
inventory growth of approximately 20% in order to meet increased demand
related to existing and developing markets.

Patents, Copyrights and Trade Secrets

     The Company's computer programs and technical know-how are its main
trade secrets, and management believes that they can best be protected by
using technical devices to protect the computer programs and by enforcing
contracts with certain employees and others with respect to the use of
proprietary information, trade secrets and covenants not to compete.  The
Company has obtained patents and copyrights with respect to aspects of its
games, and has patent applications on file for protection of certain
developments it has created.  No assurance can be given that the pending
applications will be granted.  These patents range in subject matter from 
coin-handling apparatus, fiber-optic light pens, coin-escalator mechanisms
through optical door interlock and other aspects of video and mechanical
slot machines and systems.  There can be no assurance that the patents will
not be infringed or that others will not develop technology that does not
violate the patents.

Employees

     As of September 30, 1993, the Company, including all subsidiaries,
employed approximately 2,100 persons, including 297 in administrative
positions, 153 in sales and 311 in engineering.  Of the total employees, 
International Game Technology accounted for 39; IGT-North America, 1787;
IGT-Australia, 230; IGT-Europe, 19; and IGT-Japan, 3.  None of the
Company's employees is a member of a collective bargaining unit.  

Government Regulation

     Nevada Regulation

     The manufacture, sale and distribution of gaming devices in Nevada are
subject to extensive state laws, regulations of the Nevada Gaming
Commission and State Gaming Control Board (the "Nevada Commission"), and
various county and municipal ordinances.  These laws, regulations and
ordinances primarily concern the responsibility, financial stability and
character of gaming equipment manufacturers, distributors and operators, as
well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. 
The manufacture, distribution and operation of gaming devices require
separate licenses. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the
Nevada Commission seek to (i) prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from 
having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any
capacity, (ii) establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and
procedures, (iii) maintain effective control over the financial practices
of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal
affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable
record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada
Commission, (iv) prevent cheating and fraudulent practices, and (v) provide
a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. 
Changes in such laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse
effect on the Company's operations.<PAGE>
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)


     A Nevada gaming licensee is subject to numerous restrictions.  
Licenses must be renewed periodically and licensing authorities have broad
discretion with regard to such renewals.  Licenses are not transferable.
Each type of machine sold by the Company in Nevada must first be approved
by the Nevada Commission, which may require subsequent machine
modification.  Substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and
similar financing transactions must be reported to or approved by the
Nevada Commission.  Changes in legislation or in judicial or regulatory
interpretations could occur which could adversely affect the Company.

     No publicly traded corporation is eligible to hold a gaming license,
but must be registered and found suitable to hold an interest in a
corporate subsidiary which holds a gaming license.  International Game 
Technology has been registered by the Nevada Commission as a publicly
traded holding company and was permitted to acquire IGT-North America as
its wholly-owned subsidiary.  As a registered holding company, it is
required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports to
such Commission and furnish any other information which the Commission may
require.  No person may become a stockholder of, or receive any percentage
of profits from, a licensed subsidiary without first obtaining licenses and
approvals from the Nevada Commission.  Officers, directors and key
employees of a licensed subsidiary and of the Company who are actively
engaged in the administration or supervision of gaming must be found
suitable.  No proceeds from any public sale of securities of a registered
holding corporation may be used for gaming operations in Nevada or to
acquire a gaming property without the prior approval of the Nevada
Commission.  The Company believes it has all required licenses to carry on
its business in Nevada. 

     Officers, directors and certain key employees of the Company and its
licensed gaming subsidiary are required to be licensed by the Nevada 
Commission, and employees associated with gaming must obtain work permits
which are subject to immediate suspension under certain circumstances.  In
addition, anyone having a material relationship or involvement with the
Company may be required to be found suitable or licensed, in which case
those persons would be required to pay the costs and fees of the State
Gaming Control Board (the "Control Board") in connection with the
investigation.  An application for licensure may be denied for any cause
deemed reasonable by the Nevada Commission.  Changes in licensed positions
must be reported to the Nevada Commission.  In addition to its authority to
deny an application for a license, the Nevada Commission has jurisdiction
to disapprove a change in position by such officer or key employee.  The
Nevada Commission has the power to require licensed gaming subsidiaries to
suspend or dismiss officers, directors or other key employees and to sever
relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate
applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to act in such
capacities.

     The Company and its licensed gaming subsidiary are required to submit
detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission.  If it
were determined that gaming laws were violated by a licensee, the gaming
licenses it holds could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked.  In
addition to the licensee, the Company and the persons involved could be
subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the gaming laws
at the discretion of the Nevada Commission.  In addition, a supervisor 
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the Company's gaming
property and, under certain circumstances, earnings generated during the 
supervisor's appointment could be forfeited to the State of Nevada.  The
limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming license or the
appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of the gaming license
would) materially and adversely affect the Company's operations.

     The Nevada Commission may also require any individual who has a
material relationship with the Company to be investigated and licensed or
found suitable.  Any person who acquires 5% or more of the Company's voting
securities must report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission; any person
who becomes a beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Company's voting
securities must apply for a finding of suitability.  Under certain
circumstances, an Institutional Investor, as such term is defined in the
Nevada Regulations, which acquires more than 10% of the Company's voting
securities may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of such finding
of suitability requirements.  The Nevada Commission has the power to
investigate any debt or equity security holder of the Company.  The Clark
County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board, which has jurisdiction over
gaming in the Las Vegas area, may similarly require a finding of
suitability for a security holder.  The applicant stockholder is required
to pay all costs of such investigation.  The bylaws of the Company provide
for the Company to pay such costs as to its officers, directors or
employees.

     Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability
or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada
Commission may be found unsuitable.  The same restrictions apply to a
beneficial owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the
beneficial owner.  Any stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly
or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the Common Stock beyond such 
period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Commission may be guilty
of a gross misdemeanor.  The Company is subject to disciplinary action if,
after it receives notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or
to have any other relationship with the Company, the Company (i) pays that
person any dividend or interest upon voting securities of the Company, (ii)
allows that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right
conferred through securities held by that person, (iii) gives renumeration
in any form to that person, or (iv) makes any payment to the unsuitable
person by way of principal redemption, conversion, exchange or similar
transaction.  If a security holder is found unsuitable, the Company may
itself be found unsuitable if it fails to pursue all lawful efforts to
require such unsuitable person to relinquish his voting securities for cash
at fair market value.  Additionally the Clark County authorities have taken
the position that they have the authority to approve all persons owning or 
controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming license.

     The Company is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada
which may be examined by the Nevada Commission at any time.  If any
securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder
may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the
Nevada Commission.  A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for
finding the record holder unsuitable.  The Company is also required to 
render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial
owner.  The Nevada Commission has the power at any time to require the
Company's stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that the 

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)

securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act ("the "Nevada Act")
and the regulations of the Nevada Commission.  To date, the Nevada 
Commission has not imposed such a requirement.

     The Company may not make a public offering of its securities without
the approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or proceeds
therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming
facilities in Nevada, or retire or extend obligations incurred for such
purposes.  Changes in control of the Company through merger, consolidation,
acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of
takeover cannot occur without the prior investigation of the Control Board
and approval of the Nevada Commission.  

     The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions
opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporate
defense tactics that affect corporate gaming licensees in Nevada, and
corporations whose stock is publicly-traded that are affiliated with those
operations, may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. 
The Nevada Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the
potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada's
gaming industry and to further Nevada's policy to (i) assure the financial 
stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates; (ii) preserve
the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and
(iii) promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate
affairs.  Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada
Commission before the Company can make exceptional repurchases of voting
securities above the current market price thereof and before a corporate
acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.  Nevada's gaming
regulations also require prior approval by the Nevada Commission if the
Company were to adopt a plan of recapitalization proposed by the Company's 
Board of Directors in opposition to a tender offer made directly to its 
stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the Company.

     Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered,
required to be registered, or is under common control with such persons
(collectively, "Licensees"), and who proposes to become involved in a
gaming venture outside of Nevada is required to deposit with the Control
Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000
to pay the expenses of investigation of the Control Board of the licensee's
participation in foreign gaming.  The revolving fund is subject to increase
or decrease in the discretion of the Nevada Commission.  Thereafter,
Licensees are required to comply with certain reporting requirements 
imposed by the Nevada Act.  A licensee is also subject to disciplinary
action by the Nevada Commission if it knowingly violates any laws of the
foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation, fails to 
conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of
honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations, engages in
activities that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to
collect gaming taxes and fees, or employs a person in the foreign operation
who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the
ground of personal unsuitability.

     Other Jurisdictions

     Each other jurisdiction in which the Company does business requires
various licenses, permits, and approvals in connection with the manufacture
ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (continued)    

and/or the distribution of gaming devices, and operation of progressive 
systems typically involving restrictions similar in most respects to those 
of Nevada.

     Thus far the Company has never been denied any such necessary
governmental licenses, permits or approvals.  No assurances, however, can
be given that such required licenses, permits or approvals will be given or
renewed in the future.
  
ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

     In August 1993, the Company purchased adjoining 46,000 square foot
office buildings in Reno, Nevada for use as its corporate offices.  IGT-
North America leases approximately 545,700 square feet of office, warehouse
and production facility space in Reno, Nevada and approximately 184,400
square feet of office and warehouse space in Las Vegas, Nevada.  IGT-
International currently uses a portion of the facilities leased by IGT-
North America in Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada.  Additional office and
production facilities are leased by the Company's subsidiaries in various
other states and countries where the Company conducts business, including
Colorado, Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Australia,
Canada, Japan and The Netherlands.  The Company believes that its
facilities, which are fully utilized by the Company except for a portion of
the owned office buildings which is sublet to third parties, currently are
suitable for its business and adequate for its current needs.  The Company
has entered into an agreement for the purchase of approximately 78 acres in
Reno, Nevada which the Company considers suitable for future construction
of expanded manufacturing, warehouse and corporate office facilities (see
Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
<PAGE>
ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
     
     The Company has been named in and has brought lawsuits in the normal
course of business.  Management does not expect the outcome of these suits
to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or
results of future operations.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
     Fiscal 1993 Compared to Fiscal 1992

     Net income for fiscal 1993 increased 84% to $119,025,000 or $.96 ($.90
fully diluted) per share compared to net income of $64,784,000 or $.54 per
share (adjusted to reflect a two-for-one stock split effective March 17,
1993) for fiscal 1992.  Net income in both years included income from
discontinued casino and riverboat operations of $13,447,000 in fiscal 1993
and $1,500,000 in fiscal 1992.  Income from continuing operations increased
67% to $105,578,000 or $.85 per share compared to $63,284,000 or $.53 per
share in fiscal 1992.  This increase in income from continuing operations
resulted primarily from a 42% increase in product sales and a 17% increase
in revenues from the Company's linked progressive systems business.

     Revenues and Cost of Sales

     Total revenues for fiscal 1993 increased 31% to $478.0 million.  This
increase included a 42% or $99.3 million increase in product sales and a
12% or $15.2 million increase in gaming operations revenues.  In fiscal
1993 gaming machine shipments grew to 68,900 (compared to 46,100 in fiscal
1992) primarily as a result of increased product demand in the North
American riverboat and Indian casino markets and the Southern Nevada casino
market.  The riverboat sales occurred primarily in the states of
Mississippi, Illinois and Iowa.  Currently six states have approved
riverboat gaming and seven states either have bills in legislation or are
considered likely to introduce or re-introduce riverboat legislation.

     The Company sells machines to casino operations on Indian lands
through an independent distributor.  In fiscal 1993, sales to this
distributor totaled $40.2 million compared to $27.1 million in fiscal 1992. 
It is anticipated that the Indian casino market will continue to grow as
currently approved Indian gaming facilities commence operations and as
additional Indian tribes receive approvals to conduct casino style gaming.

     The Las Vegas, Nevada market continued to expand with the opening of
the Luxor and Treasure Island hotel casinos in late fiscal 1993, and the
MGM Grand Hotel in early fiscal 1994. 

     The Company shipped 3,250 Pachisuro machines to its Japanese
distributor, following successful licensing efforts.  In addition, product
sales continued to increase in Canada, Europe and Australia as the Company
increased its efforts in these international markets.

     Gaming operations revenue increased $15.2 million or 12% to $142.4
million in fiscal 1993 as a result of a higher volume of play on the Nevada
progressive systems, the introduction of new systems in Mississippi and
Rhode Island and growth in the number of units leased to the Oregon state
lottery and North American riverboat markets.  These increases were
partially offset by the sale of the Company's Nevada route operations and
the Megapoker systems route in August and November 1992, respectively.

  IGT-International recently signed a contract with the University of
Iceland Lottery to supply the video lottery terminals and a central system
with a progressive jackpot feature.  This system began operating in
December 1993 with 350 video lottery terminals.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

     The gross margin on product sales increased to 50.2% in fiscal 1993
compared to 48.3% in fiscal 1992, reflecting improved production
efficiencies at both the IGT-North America and IGT-Australia manufacturing
facilities.

     Expenses

     Gaming operations expense increased $8.0 million or 14.7% primarily as
a result of the growth in jackpot expenses associated with the Company's
linked progressive systems.  This increase in jackpot expense reflects
increases in play on the Nevada systems and the introduction of new
systems.  Also contributing to this increase were the expenses associated
with the operation of approximately 180 gaming machines at the Reno Cannon
International Airport under an agreement which began in January 1993. 
Offsetting these expense increases was the Company's sale of its Nevada
route operations and the Megapoker route to Jackpot Enterprises.

     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million or
9.3% due to growth in the number of employees, incentive and benefit plan
cost increases, the February 1992 opening and 1993 expansion of a sales and
distribution facility in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the establishment
of a manufacturing facility in Manitoba, Canada in late fiscal 1992. 
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million or 20% as a
result of increased lease financing, wherein the Company retains ownership
of and depreciates the machines in the Colorado and Riverboat markets and
expansion of the proprietary systems business.

     The growth in research and development expense from $11.8 million to
$16.5 million resulted from the addition of engineering personnel,
increased consulting services expense, and increased incentive compensation
and benefit costs.  The provision for bad debts declined to $3.8 million
for fiscal 1993 compared to $4.6 million in the prior year.  

     Other Income and Expense

     As a result of the sales growth and the Company's ability to finance
customer sales, notes and contracts receivable increased $36.8 million or
52%, causing interest income to increase in fiscal 1993.  Also contributing
to the $7.9 million increase in interest income in fiscal 1993 was
increased income on the Company's investment of excess cash and the growth
in the systems business in which income is recognized on the Company's cash
investments used to pay progressive system jackpot winners.  Interest
expense increased $2.0 million to $12.7 million in fiscal 1993 due to
additional interest recorded on the liabilities to the progressive systems
jackpot winners.  This was partially offset by a reduction in interest
expense from the conversion of approximately $42.7 million of the Company's
convertible subordinated notes to common stock.  The continued growth of
the Company's progressive systems increases both interest income and
interest expense.  The Company records interest income on funds invested to
secure jackpot payments and records commensurate interest expense on the
outstanding liabilities to jackpot winners.

     During fiscal 1993 the Company recorded a gain of $10.1 million on the
sale of assets primarily consisting of gains on the sale of certain
securities held in the Company's investment portfolio, and to a lesser

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

extent a gain on the sale of the Megapoker route (see Note 14 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

     Discontinued Operations

     During fiscal 1993, the Company divested its investments in casino
operations through the sale of its interest in the President Riverboat
Casinos, Inc. ("PRC") and the sale of CMS.  This is in connection with the
Company's strategy to focus on its core businesses of manufacturing
machines and the development of proprietary systems software. 

     In December 1992 the Company sold its interest in PRC for $28.7
million, recognizing a gain of $23.6 million.  The net gain on the
discontinued riverboat operation after including fiscal 1993 income from
operations and after deducting the effective income taxes was $14.3
million.

     In September 1993 the Company sold its ownership interest in CMS for
$3.0 million recognizing a pre-tax loss of $2.0 million.  The net loss on
the discontinued CMS operation after including fiscal 1993 income from
operations and after adding back the effective income tax benefit was
$811,000.

Fiscal 1992 Compared to Fiscal 1991

     Net income for fiscal 1992 increased 114.3% to $64,784,000 or $.54
($.52 fully diluted) per share compared to net income of $30,230,000 or
$.26 per share (adjusted to reflect two-for-one stock splits effective
March 24, 1992 and March 17, 1993) for fiscal 1991.  This growth in
earnings is attributable to the combination of increased unit sales,
improved margin on product sales as well as higher revenues from the
Company's linked progressive systems including machine lease revenues.  Net
income for fiscal 1992 was adversely affected by a charge of $3.2 million
to record the write-down of goodwill relating to the acquisition of EDT in
January 1992, as well as the application of an additional $2.9 million of
the EDT goodwill to the net losses on the dispositions of the Nevada route
and keno systems sales operations.

     Revenues and Cost of Sales

     Total revenues for fiscal 1992 increased 56.0% to $363.6 million from
$233.0 million for fiscal 1991.  The growth in revenue was composed of
increases in product sales and gaming operations revenue of $80.7 million
and $49.9 million, respectively.  

     The increase in product sales revenue of 51.8% to $236.4 million
during fiscal 1992 resulted from strong demand in expanding markets
including three Colorado mining towns, U.S. military markets, Native
American casinos, riverboats in Illinois, Iowa and Mississippi, and
increased sales in Queensland, Australia.  Product sales to traditional
markets, including Nevada, the Company's single largest market, were about
the same as the prior year.  Approximately 66% of fiscal 1992 unit sales
were to new and emerging markets while 34% of product sales were to
traditional gaming markets.  The growth in product sales revenue during the
current fiscal year is also attributable to video gaming terminal (VGT)

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

sales to Louisiana and to the Manitoba Lottery Foundation in Canada. 
Worldwide product sales for the year ended September 30, 1992, included
over 46,000 gaming machines as compared to approximately 31,000 during the
prior year.

     Revenues from gaming operations grew to $127.2 million in fiscal 1992
from $77.3 million during fiscal 1991, an increase of 64.5%.  This
percentage increase is primarily due to a higher volume of play on the
Nevada progressive systems and higher revenues for franchise and licensing
fees for linked progressive systems in Atlantic City casinos. 
Additionally, income generated from leased machines to the Oregon State
Lottery and to customers in Colorado provided new sources of gaming and
casino operations revenue in fiscal 1992.

     The increased play on the Nevada systems is primarily a result of
enhancements to existing systems including Megabucks and Quartermania, the
record Megabucks jackpot of over $9 million which was won on May 30, 1992,
as well as the introduction of Fabulous Fifties in August of 1991. 
Additions to the number of Nevada Nickels system locations also contributed
to this growth.  The increase in the Atlantic City progressive systems
revenue resulted primarily from greater revenues recognized from the
Megabucks and Quartermania systems, as well as from the addition of
Fabulous Fifties in April 1991 and Star Poker in September 1991.

     The gross profit on product sales grew to 48.3% for fiscal 1992 as
compared to 44.6% for fiscal 1991.  The improved margin resulted from
production efficiencies associated with higher sales volume as well as
lower discounts offered during fiscal 1992.

     Expenses

     Gaming operations expense increased $10.0 million to $54.7 million as
a result of the growth in the linked progressive systems business mentioned
above, as well as increased costs associated with purchasing investments to
fund liabilities to jackpot winners.  As the number of jackpots won on the
Nevada progressive systems increases and the jackpot payouts grow, the
costs associated with purchasing investments to fund the liabilities to
jackpot winners increase gaming operations expense correspondingly.  

     Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 39.2% to $52.6
million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1992, as compared to $37.8
million for the same prior year period.  The increase was due to the
Company's sales and marketing efforts in new and existing markets,
including international sales in Europe and Australia and the expansion of
gaming in Colorado.  Additionally, costs associated with the acquisition of
the EDT publicly owned common stock, expenses incurred in the public
offering of the shares held by the Company in the riverboat operation and
increased employee benefits and incentive programs attributable to improved
earnings provided for the overall increase in selling, general and
administrative expense.

     Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6.9 million to $16.8
million for fiscal 1992, compared to $9.9 million for fiscal 1991,
resulting from depreciation recorded on machines leased in Colorado and 
Oregon as well as amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

the EDT publicly owned common stock in January 1992.  Research and
development expense grew to $11.8 million from $9.4 million attributable to
expenses related to product upgrades and enhancements and developments of
new proprietary software systems.

     The provision for bad debts decreased $207,000 to $4.6 million as the 
Company feels the reserves for uncollectible receivables are adequate.

     Other Income and Expense

     Interest income for fiscal 1992 increased $6.4 million or 53.7% to
$18.4 million over the prior year period primarily as a result of the
investment of proceeds received from the issuance in May 1991 of $115
million principal amount of Convertible Subordinated Notes.  Additionally,
the growth is attributable to the income recognized on the Company's cash
investments utilized to pay progressive systems jackpot winners.  Interest
expense increased 80.3% to $10.8 million as a result of the issuance of the
Convertible Subordinated Notes, and the additional interest expense
recorded on the liabilities to progressive systems jackpot winners.  

     The Company recorded a benefit of $256,000 related to the minority
interest in losses of EDT.  This compares to a benefit of $1,248,000 for
the minority interest in losses of EDT in fiscal 1991.

     The Company recorded a net loss of $1.0 million on the sale of assets
primarily composed of the $893,000 net loss on the sale of the Nevada Route
operations (see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements).

     During fiscal 1992, the Company recorded a $3.2 million charge to
other non-operating expense resulting from the write-down of goodwill
associated with the acquisition of EDT publicly owned common stock in
January 1992.  The goodwill was assigned proportionally to the separable
asset groups acquired and the remaining goodwill in which the Company could
not justifiably assign was written-off.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Working Capital

     Working capital increased $119.3 million during the year to $376.4
million at September 30, 1993 primarily as a result of a $51.8 million
increase in short-term investments, a $25.4 million increase in accounts
receivable, a $16.2 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $16.1
million increase in current maturities of long-term notes and contracts
receivable and a $12.4 million increase in inventories.  The increase in
accounts receivable is due to large sales in September 1993 to two new
hotel casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada mentioned above and increased sales in
the fourth quarter to the Company's Indian casino distributor.  The
increase in short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents resulted
from the generation of cash from operating and investing activities.  The
increase in the current maturities of long-term notes and contracts
receivable is a result of an increase in the amount of sales financed in
fiscal 1993, particularly in the last two quarters of the year.  Of the
$12.4 million increase in inventories, $11.8 million represents an increase
ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

in raw materials used to support increased production levels and greater
product diversification.

     Cash Flow

     During fiscal 1993, the Company's cash and cash equivalents increased
$16.2 million to $85.3 million.  Cash provided by operating activities for
the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991 totaled $56.1 million,
$38.6 million and $59.0 million, respectively.  Cash provided by operating
activities was reduced by significant increases in receivables and
inventories during 1992 and 1993.  Larger inventories have been required to
support increased sales.  The Company has also been able to provide
financing for the product sales growth.  The primary sources of cash from
financing activities included $48.0 million, $33.5 million and $26.8
million in proceeds from systems to fund liabilities to jackpot winners for
the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  In 1993,
for the first time in the Company's history, cash dividends were paid,
totaling $7.4 million.  Additionally, during the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1991, the Company received net proceeds of $89.4 million from
the issuance of $115 million principal amount of Convertible Subordinated
Notes.  

     Purchases of property, plant, and equipment totaling $46.0 million,
$32.5 million and $20.4 million in fiscal 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, partially offset increases in cash and cash equivalents
during these periods.  The additions to property, plant, and equipment
consist primarily of the capitalization of gaming machines and equipment
leased in certain gaming jurisdictions along with purchases of office
furniture and computer equipment to support the Company's expansion. 
Additionally in fiscal 1993, the Company acquired land and office buildings
of $5.2 million for use by corporate and engineering personnel and a $10.0
million aircraft for regional and international travel needs.  The Company
entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 78 acres for the
Company's future plant and facilities expansion for a total purchase price
of approximately $6,129,000, (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements).  The funds for this purchase, as well as the other capital
expenditures anticipated during fiscal 1994, will be derived from the
Company's existing cash flow.

     The Company's cash requirements for purposes of principal payments on
outstanding debt declined substantially from $28.5 million in fiscal 1991
to $0.9 million in fiscal 1993, as a result of the repayment of outstanding
debt through the issuance of the Convertible Subordinated Notes.  Assuming
no material change in the financial markets, the Company anticipates that
all of the $60.0 million principal amount of outstanding notes at September
30, 1993 will be converted to common stock by the third quarter of fiscal
1994.

     During December 1992, the Company received $44.7 million in proceeds
from the initial public offering of the Company's ownership of certain
riverboat operations.  These proceeds consisted of $16.2 million as payment
for outstanding loans including interest from the riverboat operations and 
$28.5 million as proceeds from the sale of 100% of its equity in the 
riverboat operations.  The Company also received $1,000,000 as cash 
proceeds from the sale of its ownership in CMS International.  See Note 12

Operations.

     Stock Repurchase Plan

     On October 3, 1989, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase
of up to ten percent of the Company's then outstanding shares.  Pursuant to
such Board action a total of 8,338,904 shares (as adjusted for the two-for-
one stock splits effective July 16, 1990, August 23, 1991, March 24, 1992,
and March 17, 1993) had been repurchased as of September 30, 1990.  On
October 4, 1990, the Board reaffirmed this authorization and authorized a
further repurchase of 12.0 million shares to a total of 23.6 million
shares.  During the three years ended September 30, 1993,the Company
repurchased an additional 2,768,876 shares for an aggregate purchase price
of $8,895,000.

     Recently Issued Accounting Standards to be Adopted

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued in May 1993 SFAS No.
115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." 
This statement, effective for the Company's fiscal year ending  September
30, 1995, will require that unrealized gains and losses on securities
defined as "trading securities" be included in income and that unrealized
gains and losses on securities defined as "available-for-sale" will be
excluded from income and reported in a separate component of stockholders'
equity.  If this standard had been adopted at September 30, 1993, the
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities would have increased
income from continuing operations before income taxes by $258,000 in fiscal
1993, and the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
would have increased stockholders' equity by $14,871,000 at September 30,
1993.

     Lines of Credit

     As of September 30, 1993, IGT-North America had a $7.5 million
unsecured bank line of credit with various interest rate options available
to the Company. The line of credit is used for the purpose of facilitating
standby letters of credit, and the Company is charged a nominal fee on 
amounts used against the line as security for letters of credit.  Funds 
available under this line are reduced by any amounts used as security for
letters of credit.   At September 30, 1993, $4,092,000 was available under
this line of credit.                 

     IGT-Australia had a $440,000 (Australian) bank line of credit
available as of September 30, 1993.  Interest is paid at the lender's
reference rate plus 1%.  This line is secured by equitable mortgages, and
has a provision for review and renewal annually in May.  At September 30,
1993, no funds were drawn under this line.

     The Company is required to comply, and is in compliance, with certain
covenants contained in its line of credit agreement which, among other
things, limit financial commitments the Company may make without the
written consent of the lender and require the maintenance of certain
financial ratios, minimum working capital and net worth of the Company.  

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)


     Riverboat Disposition

     During December 1992, the Company transferred 100% of its ownership 
interest in three riverboat partnerships to President Riverboat Casinos,
("PRC") a company incorporated to facilitate a public offering of the 
riverboat gaming operations.  In exchange for the transfer of its ownership
interests, the Company received 1,671,429 shares of PRC common stock
representing an approximate 32% ownership of PRC.

     The Company subsequently sold all of its 1,671,429 shares of PRC
common stock in an initial public offering (the "IPO") of PRC effective
December 17, 1992.  The Company realized net proceeds from the IPO of $28.5
million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $23.6 million on the sale.  PRC
additionally repaid $16.2 million in outstanding notes to the Company, plus
accrued interest.

     CMS Disposition

     Effective September 30, 1993, the Company sold its equity ownership
interest in CMS to Summit Casinos-Nevada, Inc., ("Summit"), whose owners
include senior management of CMS.  The sale consisted of $750,000 in cash
for the Company's ownership of CMS's preferred stock and $250,000 in cash
and a note of $2,043,529 for CMS's common stock.  Additionally, the Company
acquired a stock purchase warrant entitling the Company to purchase a 4.84%
of CMS at a per share price approximately equal to the book value of CMS
("the CMS Warrant").  The CMS Warrant, which expires on the earlier of
September 30, 2003 or the closing of an underwritten public offering of
CMS, is exchangeable for a Warrant to purchase shares of common stock of
any other affiliate of Summit which proposes an underwritten public
offering of its common stock.  The Company will remain as guarantor on
certain indebtedness of CMS, which had an aggregate balance of $18.6
million at September 30, 1993.  Management believes the likelihood of
losses relating to these guarantees is remote (see Note 12 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements).

IMPACT OF INFLATION

     Inflation has not had a significant effect on the Company's operations
during the three fiscal years ended September 30, 1993.

     of International Game Technology:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
International Game Technology and Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1993 and
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and
changes in stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1993.  Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14(a)(2).  These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of International Game
Technology and Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September 30, 1993 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, such consolidated
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

     Organization - International Game Technology (the "Company") was
incorporated in December 1980 to acquire the gaming licensee and operating
entity, IGT (recently renamed IGT-North America), and facilitate the
Company's initial public offering.  In addition to its 100% ownership of
IGT-North America, the Company directly or indirectly owns 100% of IGT-
International, ("IGT-International"), 100% of IGT-Australia, Pty. Ltd.
("IGT-Australia"), 100% of IGT-Europe b.v. ("IGT-Europe"), 99.75% of IGT-
Iceland Ltd. ("IGT-Iceland") and 100% of IGT-Japan k.k. ("IGT-Japan").  In
December 1993 the Company sold its interest in its riverboat partnerships
and additionally on September 30, 1993 sold its interest in CMS-
International ("CMS"). 

     IGT-North America is the largest manufacturer of computerized casino
gaming products and proprietary systems in the world.  IGT-North America
believes it manufactures the broadest range of microprocessor-based gaming
machines available.  The Company also develops and manufactures "SMART"
systems which monitor slot machine play and track player activity.  In
addition to gaming product sales and leases, IGT-North America has
developed and sells computerized linked proprietary systems to monitor
video gaming terminals and has developed specialized video gaming terminals
for lotteries and other applications.  IGT-North America also develops and
operates proprietary software linked progressive systems.  The Company
derives revenues related to the operations of these systems as well as
collects license and franchise fees for the use of the systems.  

     IGT-International was established in September 1993 to oversee all
sales of gaming products outside of North America by the Company's foreign
subsidiaries and to conduct sales either directly or through distributors
in countries not served by the Company's foreign subsidiaries.

     IGT-Australia, located in Sydney, Australia, manufactures
microprocessor-based gaming products and proprietary systems, and performs
engineering, manufacturing, sales and marketing and distribution operations
for the Australian markets as well as other gaming jurisdictions in the
Southern Hemisphere and Pacific Rim.

     IGT-Europe was established in The Netherlands in February 1992 to
distribute and market gaming products in Eastern and Western Europe and
Africa.  Prior to providing direct sales, the Company sold its products in
these markets through a distributor.  

     IGT-Iceland was established in September 1993 to provide video lottery
system software, machines, equipment and technical assistance to support
Iceland's video lottery operations.

     IGT-Japan was established in July 1990, and in November 1992 opened an
office in Tokyo, Japan.  On April 16, 1993, IGT-Japan was approved to
supply Pachisuro gaming machines to the Japanese market, and the Company
began delivery of these machines during the third quarter of fiscal 1993.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     (continued)

     Discontinued Operations

     Iowa Riverboat Corporation ("IRC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, established in March 1990, was a 40% partner in an Iowa
partnership that owned and operated the President riverboat casino and the
Blackhawk Hotel in Davenport, Iowa.  International Acceptance Corporation
("IAC"), also a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owned 45% of a
riverboat excursion operation and the permanently docked Admiral riverboat
in St. Louis, Missouri.  In December 1992, the Company contributed the
assets of IRC and IAC to PRC in exchange for 1,671,429 shares of PRC common
stock.  These shares were subsequently sold to the public as part of an
initial public offering of PRC common stock on December 17, 1992 (see Note
12).

     CMS, established in August 1988, operated casinos and hotel/casinos
for the Company including the Silver Club hotel and casino and The Treasury
Club casino in Sparks, Nevada, the El Capitan Club in Hawthorne, Nevada and
the King's Casino on the island of Antigua in the Caribbean.  Effective
September 30, 1993 the Company sold its ownership interest in CMS to Summit
Casinos Nevada, Inc. (see Note 12).

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its majority owned subsidiaries.  All material intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The disposal of interests
in riverboat partnerships and CMS (collectively, "casino operations") has
been accounted for as discontinued operations.  Accordingly, operating
results and cash flows of casino operations are segregated and reported as
discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income and cash flows.  Prior year financial statements have been restated
to conform to the current year presentation.

     Common Stock Split - On March 17, 1993, the Company effected a two-
for-one split of its common stock and a corresponding reduction in the par
value of its common stock from $.00125 to $.000625 per share.  Prior years'
shares outstanding and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the
stock split.

     Product Sales - The Company makes product sales for cash, on normal
credit terms (90 days or less), over longer term installments, and through
participation in the net winnings of the machines until the purchase price
is paid.  Generally, sales are recorded when title passes to the customer. 
Participation sales are recorded when the product is installed unless the
customer does not agree in writing to keep the product installed until the
purchase price is paid, in which case the installment method is used.

     Sales of slot management systems generally involve contracts covering
periods up to twelve months. Billings on such contracts are made
periodically in accordance with contract terms.  Revenues are recognized 
when the title passes to the customer.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     (continued)

     Gaming Operations - Gaming operations revenues consist of revenues
relating to the operations of the proprietary systems division, a share of
the net gaming winnings from the operation of machines at customer
locations, and the lease and rental of gaming and video lottery machines.
Revenue from systems products installed in New Jersey casinos is not
recognized until receipt is assured.

     The Company's proprietary systems are primarily operated in Nevada and
Atlantic City, New Jersey.  In Atlantic City, each system is operated by an
independent trust managed by representatives from the participating
casinos.  The trust records a liability to the Company for annual casino
fees as well as machine rental fees.  In Nevada, the systems are operated
by the Company.  The Nevada casinos retain the net win, less a percentage
paid to the Company to fund the progressive jackpots.  The Company earns
interest on these funds until jackpots are paid.  These jackpots are paid
out in equal installments without interest over a twenty year period.  The
Company records the percentage received as revenue and records as expense
all costs associated with its obligation to fund the jackpot liabilities.

     The following table shows the revenues recorded from gaming
operations.

     Total. . . . . . . . . . .      $142,389  $127,222  $ 77,320

     At September 30, 1993 and 1992, the Company had accrued approximately
$118.4 million and $81.5 million, respectively, for its share of
outstanding progressive jackpot liabilities.  This liability includes the
amount required to provide for payments to systems jackpot winners.  The
Company is required to maintain cash and investments relating to systems
liabilities in separate accounts.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents - This includes cash required for funding
current systems jackpot payments as well as purchasing investments to meet
obligations for making payments to jackpot winners.  Cash in excess of
daily requirements is generally invested in various marketable securities. 
If these securities have original maturities of three months or less they
are considered cash equivalents.  Such investments are stated at cost,
which approximates market, and are deemed to be cash equivalents for
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows.  

     Short-Term Investments - This represents a portfolio of marketable
securities consisting primarily of U.S. government securities, corporate
bonds with original maturities beyond three months and common and preferred
stocks.  Similar items with original maturities of three months or less are
considered to be cash equivalents.  Marketable securities are carried at
the lower of their aggregate cost or market value.

1.   Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     (continued)

     Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out method) or market.

     Depreciation and Amortization - Depreciation and amortization are
provided on the straight-line method over the following useful lives:

        Gaming operations equipment . . . . . . . . .   1 to 5 years
        Manufacturing machinery and equipment . . . .   3 to 5 years
        Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   40 years
        Leasehold improvements. . . . . . . . . . . .   Term of Lease
        Building under capital lease. . . . . . . . .   Term of Lease

     Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  The costs of
improvements are capitalized.  Gains or losses on the disposition of assets
are included in income.

     Investments to Fund Liabilities to Jackpot Winners -  These
investments represent discounted U.S. Treasury Securities purchased to meet
obligations for making payments to Nevada, Mississippi, Colorado and South
Dakota linked progressive systems winners.  Such investments are stated at
cost.  Nevada and Mississippi gaming regulations provide how these funds
are to be maintained.

     Other Assets - Other assets include debt issue costs, deposits,
patents, goodwill and gaming rights.  Debt issue costs are amortized as a
component of interest expense on the Convertible Subordinated Notes (see
Note 11).  The cost of gaming rights is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the terms of the agreements.  Patents and goodwill are amortized over
periods of seven years and five years, respectively.  

     Earnings Per Share - Earnings per share is computed based upon the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding. 
Prior period weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share
have been restated to reflect the effects of the Company's 1993 stock  
split.  The Convertible Subordinated Notes (see Note 11) are not common
stock equivalents, and they were excluded from the calculation of fully-
diluted earnings per share in 1991 when their effect was anti-dilutive.

     Foreign Currency Translation - The financial statements of foreign
subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated
reporting purposes in accordance with SFAS No. 52.  All asset and liability
accounts have been translated using the current exchange rate at the
balance sheet date.  Income statement amounts have been translated using
the average exchange rate for the year.  The gains and losses resulting 
from the translation adjustments have been accumulated as a component of 
stockholders' equity, being netted against retained earnings due to the 
immateriality of the amounts.  The effect on the consolidated statements of
operations of translation gains and losses is insignificant for all years
presented.

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
     (continued)

     Recently Issued Accounting Standards to be Adopted - The Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued in May 1993 SFAS No. 115 "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities."  This statement,
effective for the Company's fiscal year ending  September 30, 1995, will
require that unrealized gains and losses on securities defined as "trading
securities" be included in income and that unrealized gains and losses on
securities defined as "available-for-sale" will be excluded from income and
reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity.  If this standard
had been adopted at September 30, 1993, the unrealized gains and losses on
trading securities would have increased income from continuing operations
before income taxes by $258,000 in fiscal 1993, and the unrealized gains
and losses on available-for-sale securities would have increased
stockholders' equity by $14,871,000 at September 30, 1993.

     Reclassification - Certain amounts in the 1992 and 1991 consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to be consistent with the
presentation used in fiscal year 1993.

     On a consolidated basis the Company does not recognize intersegment
revenues or expenses upon the transfer of gaming products between segments. 
Operating profit is revenue and interest income less cost of sales and
operating expenses, including related operating depreciation and
amortization, and provisions for bad debts.  Other expenses include
selling, general and administrative expense, interest expense, interest
income and research and development expense.

     During the fiscal years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992, the Company
made net sales of $40.2 million and $27.1 million, respectively, to Sodak
Gaming, the Company's principal distributor of gaming products to Native
American Indian reservations in Wisconsin, Minnesota and to other areas in
the midwest and western United States.  These sales aggregated
approximately 11.1% and 11.4% of the Company's total product sales for the

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

fiscal years 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The Company believes the loss of
this customer would not have a long term material adverse effect on product
sales of the Company as other means of distribution to this market is
available.  No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total product
sales of the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1991.

     The Company had total export sales from the United States of
approximately $13,522,000, $29,006,000 and $25,514,000 during the fiscal
years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  This amount
declined in the year ended September 30, 1993 primarily due to the
exclusion of Canadian sales in fiscal 1993 as a result of the Company's
production of gaming machines in Canada starting in late fiscal 1992.

3.   Notes and Contracts Receivable

     The Company grants customers extended payment terms under contracts of
sale.  These contracts are generally for terms of one to five years, with
interest recognized at prevailing rates, and are secured by the related
equipment sold.

     The Company has provided loans, principally for financial assistance,
to several customers.  At September 30, 1993 and 1992, the balance of such
loans totaled $994,000 and $936,000, respectively, net of the related
allowance for doubtful accounts of $25,000 and $321,000, respectively. 
These loans are generally for terms of one to five years with interest at
prevailing rates.

     The following table represents, at September 30, 1993, the estimated
future collections of notes and contracts receivable (net of allowances):

4.   Lines of Credit

     As of September 30, 1993, IGT-North America had a $7.5 million
unsecured bank line of credit with various interest rate options available
to the Company. The line of credit is used for the purpose of facilitating
standby letters of credit, and the Company is charged a nominal fee on
amounts used against the line as security for letters of credit.  Funds
available under this line are reduced by any amounts used as security for
letters of credit.   At September 30, 1993 $4,092,000 was available under
this line of credit.

     IGT-Australia had a $440,000 (Australian) bank line of credit
available as of September 30, 1993.  Interest is paid at the lender's
reference rate plus 1%.  This line is secured by equitable mortgages, and
has a provision for review and renewal annually in May.  At September 30,
1993, no funds were drawn under this line.

     The Company is required to comply, and is in compliance, with certain
covenants contained in the IGT line of credit agreement which, among other
things, limit financial commitments the Company may make without written
consent of the lender and require the maintenance of certain financial
ratios, minimum working capital and net worth of the Company.

     During 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."  The impact of
adopting this new standard was not material to any of the consolidated
financial statements of the Company for 1993.  Prior to 1993, the Company
accounted for income taxes under SFAS No. 96.

     Statement 109 requires recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been included in the financial statements or tax returns.  Deferred income
taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards.  The tax items comprising the Company's net
deferred tax liability as of September 30, 1993 are as follows:

6.   Income Taxes (continued)

     In August of 1993, enacted changes in Federal legislation increased
the income tax rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1993.  The rate
increased from 34% to 35%, with a blended rate being applied in fiscal
1993.

7.   Employee Benefit Plans

     Employee Profit Sharing Plans

     In 1980, IGT-North America adopted a qualified profit sharing
retirement plan for its employees.  Company contributions to the plan are
at the sole discretion of the Company's Board of Directors.  Benefits vest
over a seven-year period of employment.  Under a discretionary program
effective January 1, 1986, and reviewable by the Board annually,
contributions are based on 5% of annual IGT-North America pre-tax operating
profits above a set minimum.  Effective for 1993, 1992 and 1991, the
minimum pre-tax operating profits were $44,000,000, $28,000,000 and
$12,000,000, respectively, before any allocation to the Plan.  

     Additionally, a cash sharing plan was adopted by IGT-North America
effective January 1, 1986, in which 5% of annual pre-tax operating profits
of IGT-North America (in excess of $44,000,000, $28,000,000 and
$12,000,000, for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively), are distributed to
employees on a semiannual basis.  Contributions to the plan are reviewed
annually by the Board.  

     The Company's other subsidiaries have similar retirement and cash
sharing plans with one of the plans designed as a superannuation program. 
Total consolidated profit sharing and cash sharing expense was $12,564,000,
$9,893,000 and $4,573,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1993, 
1992 and 1991, respectively.

     IGT-North America maintains a discretionary management bonus and a
marketing management bonus plan in which key employees participate. 
Effective January 1, 1986, 5% of IGT's annual pre-tax operating profits (in
excess of $44,000,000, $28,000,000 and $12,000,000 for 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively) are distributed under the management bonus plan.  Bonuses for
marketing management are computed using a formula based on product sales
levels and gross profit margins achieved.  The Company's other operating
subsidiaries maintain similar plans.  Total consolidated expense under
these plans was $8,435,000,
$5,598,000 and $3,430,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.

     Stock Option Plans

     In 1981, the Company adopted a Stock Option Plan under which
nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase up to 27,104,000
shares may be granted and, in 1993, the Company adopted a Stock Option Plan
under which nonqualified and incentive stock options to purchase up to
3,000,000 shares may be granted to employees and up to 250,000 nonqualified
stock options may be granted to non-employee directors of the Company.

7.   Employee Benefit Plans (continued)

Options granted have been granted at fair market value on the date of grant
and, except for non-employee director options, typically become exercisable
in five annual installments although a shorter period may be provided.  At
September 30, 1993, options to purchase 4,011,696 shares were available for
grant under the plans.

     Employee Stock Purchase Plan

     Effective February 26, 1987, the Company adopted a Qualified Employee
Stock Purchase Plan.  Under this Plan, each eligible employee may be
granted an option to purchase a specific number of shares of the Company's
common stock.  The term of each option is twelve months, and the exercise
date is the last day of the option period.  Eligible employees include only
those employees who have completed twelve months of continuous service with
the Company.  The Plan excludes employees who are officers, 5% or more
shareholders, employees receiving more than $64,245 in annual compensation
and employees of certain subsidiaries.

     An aggregate of 2,400,000 shares may be made available under this
plan.  Employees may participate in this plan only through payroll
deductions up to a maximum of 10% of their base pay.  The option price is
equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on
the date of grant or on the date of exercise.  At September 30, 1993,
1,100,472 shares were available under this plan.

     401(k) Matching Program

     Effective January 1, 1993, the Company offered a 401(k) retirement
plan contribution matching program.  Under the plan agreement, the Company
matches 100% of employee contributions up to $500 and an additional 50% of
the next $500 contributed by the employee.  This allows for maximum annual
Company contributions of $750 to each employee's 401(k) account.  The
employees will be 100% vested in Company contributions at the date the
contribution is made.  In fiscal 1993 the Company contributed $512,000
under this plan.

     Riverboat Operations

     The Company had an equity ownership interest in riverboat operations
based in Davenport, Iowa and St. Louis, Missouri (see Note 12).  The
Company recognized revenues from sales to these operations, net of
intercompany eliminations for its equity ownership, of $179,000 and
$3,778,000 during the fiscal years ended September 30, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.  The Company had accounts and notes receivable from these
businesses of $4,196,000 at September 30, 1992.  The Company made loans
totalling $11.8 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1991, to
the partnerships which manage the riverboat operations.  Each of the loans
included interest at 13%, with annual payments of principal and interest. 
The principal balance outstanding on the notes at September 30, 1992, was
$13,167,000.  The Company accrued interest income related to these loans
totalling $393,000, $1,645,000 and $757,000 during the fiscal years ended
September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The loans and accrued
interest receivable were paid from the proceeds of the public offering
discussed in Note 12.

11.  Debt Offering

     In May 1991, the Company completed a $115,000,000 public offering of
5-1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") maturing June 1, 2001.

     The Notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time
prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into common stock of the
Company at a conversion rate of 129.384 shares per each $1,000 principal
amount, subject to 
adjustments in certain events.  During fiscal 1993 and 1992, notes with a
face amount of $42,719,000 and $85,000 were converted to 5,527,133 and
10,998 shares of the Company's common stock, respectively.

     The Notes may be redeemed by the Company on or after June 1, 1994, in
              INTERNATIONAL GAME TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

11.  Debt Offering (continued)

whole at any time, or in part from time to time, at specified percentages,
graduating annually, of principal amount due at maturity together with
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.  Interest payments
at 5-1/2% are payable semiannually.  The Notes were issued at a price of
80.055% of the principal amount due at maturity, representing an original
issue discount of 19.945% from the principal amount payable at maturity.  
The 5-1/2% semiannual interest payments and the original issue discount
represent a yield of 8.5% per annum.

     The Notes are subordinated to prior payment in full of all senior
indebtedness of the Company as defined in the indenture governing the
Notes, including such indebtedness incurred in the future by the Company
and its subsidiaries.  Net proceeds from the issue and sale of the Notes
were $89,426,800.  Approximately $18 million of the proceeds were used to
repay indebtedness.  The remainder of the proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital.  

12.  Discontinued Operations

     In connection with the Company's focus on gaming machine manufacture
and proprietary software systems development, the Company has divested its
investments in casino operations during fiscal 1993 through the sale of its
interest in CMS and President Riverboat Casinos, Inc. ("PRC").  The
disposition of these investments has been accounted for as discontinued
operations.  The revenues from these operations totaled $34,807,000,
$35,849,000 and $33,865,000 for fiscal years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.  The separate sales transactions of these investments are
described below.

     Riverboat Operations

     During December 1992, the Company transferred 100% of its ownership
interest in three riverboat partnerships to PRC.  In exchange for the
transfer of its ownership interests, the Company received 1,671,429 shares
of PRC common stock representing an approximate 32% ownership of PRC.

     The Company, under a selling agreement with the principal stockholders
of PRC, offered all of its 1,671,429 shares of PRC common stock as a
selling shareholder in the initial public offering ("IPO") of PRC,
effective December 17, 1992.  The Company received proceeds from the IPO of
$28.7 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $23.6 million on the sale. 
PRC additionally repaid $16.2 million in outstanding notes to the Company,
plus all accrued interest.

     CMS International

     Effective September 30, 1993, the Company sold its equity ownership
interest in CMS to Summit Casinos-Nevada, Inc., ("Summit"), whose owners
include senior management of CMS.  The sale consisted of $750,000 in cash
for the Company's ownership of CMS's preferred stock and $250,000 in cash
and a note of $2,043,529 for CMS's common stock.  Additionally, the Company
acquired a stock purchase warrant entitling the Company to purchase a 4.84%
              INTERNATIONAL GAME TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES

                NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

12.  Discontinued Operations (continued)

of CMS at a per share price approximately equal to the book value of CMS
("the CMS Warrant").  The CMS Warrant, which expires on the earlier of
September 30, 2003 or the closing of an underwritten public offering of
CMS, is exchangeable for a Warrant to purchase shares of common stock of  
any other affiliate of Summit which proposes an underwritten public
offering of its common stock.  

     The Company recognized a pre-tax loss of approximately $2.0 million on
the sale and will remain as guarantor on certain indebtedness of CMS, which
had at September 30, 1993 an aggregate balance of $18.6 million.  The notes
that have been guaranteed are also collateralized by the respective casino
properties.  Summit has agreed to indemnify and hold the Company harmless
against any liability arising under these guarantees.  Management believes
the likelihood of losses relating to these guarantees is remote.

     The composition of income from discontinued operations in fiscal 1993
is as follows:

13.  EDT Common Stock

     On January 31, 1992, the stockholders of EDT, previously a 43% owned
subsidiary of the Company, approved the exchange of 57% of the EDT common
stock owned by the public for common stock of the Company.

     Under the exchange agreement, the market value of the Company's stock
used in the conversion was equal to the average of the per share closing
prices of the Company's stock on the NYSE for the ten consecutive days
ending on the sixth trading day immediately preceding the January 31, 1992,
EDT stockholders meeting at which the exchange was approved.  As defined,
the average price of the Company's stock applied on the conversion date was
$49.65, as adjusted to reflect two-for-one stock splits effective March 24,
1992 and March 17, 1993.  Accordingly, the outstanding EDT public shares
were converted to approximately 876,000 shares of the Company's common
stock and EDT became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  The
operations of EDT have been merged into those of IGT-North America.

14.  Disposition of Other Operations

     The route and Megapoker operations and Keno systems business were sold
during fiscal 1992 and 1993.  The Company's route and Megapoker operations

were sold to Jackpot Enterprises, a Nevada corporation in August and
November of 1992, respectively.  The route operations included all the
route equipment and operating contracts for the Nevada participation
locations involving approximately 1,380 gaming machines in 160 locations. 
This sale resulted in a net loss of $893,000.  The Megapoker sale included
all gaming services and associated equipment used on the Megapoker route 
along with licenses for all Megapoker software, trademarks, and tradenames.
A net gain of $242,000 was realized on this sale.

     In the first quarter of 1993, the Company completed the sale of its
computerized keno system business to Imagineering Systems, Inc. of Reno,
Nevada.  All development, manufacturing, sales and service functions for
the keno systems were included in the sale.  The sale did not have a
material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

15.  Supplemental Statement of Cash Flows Information

     Certain noncash investing and financing activities are not reflected
in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The Company incurred capital
lease obligations to obtain property, plant and equipment in the years
ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991 of $46,000, $1,429,000, and
$651,000, respectively.  Additionally, the Company exchanged common stock
of the Company for EDT common stock (see Note 13).  The Company had no
additions to long-term notes payable during the fiscal years ended
September 30, 1993 and 1992.  In fiscal 1991 the Company recorded additions
to long-term notes payable of $58,000.

     Payments of interest for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and
1991 were $12,030,000, $12,132,000 and $6,803,000, respectively.  Payments
for income taxes for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991 were
$65,699,000, $31,825,000 and $12,045,000, respectively.

     During fiscal 1993 and 1992 notes with a face amount of $42,719,000
and $85,000 were converted to 5,527,133 and 10,998 shares of the Company's
common stock, respectively.

     The Company had dividends declared, but not yet paid at September 30,
1993 totaling $3,746,000.

     The tax benefit of stock options totaled $20,147,000, $12,358,000 and
$1,810,000 for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992, and 1991,

 The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments
to fund liabilities to jackpot winners, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and notes payable and capital lease obligations approximate fair
value because of the short term maturity of those instruments.  The
estimated fair value of short term investments, long term investments to
fund liabilities to jackpot winners, and the convertible subordinated notes
payable are based on quoted market prices.

 The fair value of the Company's notes and contracts receivable is
estimated by discounting the future cash flows using interest rates
determined by management to reflect the credit risk and remaining
maturities of the related notes and contracts.

 In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial
instruments with off-balance-sheet risk such as performance bonds and other
guarantees, which are not reflected in the accompanying balance sheets. 
Management does not expect any material losses to result from these off-
balance-sheet instruments.

18.  Concentrations of Credit Risk

 The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents and accounts, contracts, and notes receivable.  The Company
maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions in
amounts, which at times, may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limits.

18.  Concentrations of Credit Risk (continued)

     Product sales and the resulting receivables are concentrated in
specific legalized gaming regions.  The Company also distributes a
significant portion of its products through third party distributors
resulting in significant distributor receivables.  At September 30, 1993
accounts, contracts, and notes receivable by region as a percentage of
total receivables are as follows:

           Regions
           Nevada . . . . . . . . . . . .   29.3%
           Riverboats (greater
             Mississippi River area). . .   18.6%
           Indian Casinos (distributor) .   11.1%
           Colorado . . . . . . . . . . .    8.8%
           Louisiana (distributor). . . .    6.5%

19.  Subsequent Event - Agreement to Purchase 78 acres

     The Company has entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 78
acres for $78,571 per acre or a total price of approximately $6,129,000. 
The closing of this purchase is subject to the seller receiving certain
approvals from the City of Reno including approval to include the acquired
parcel within the existing South Meadows Properties Planned Unit
Development.  Closing is expected to occur in the quarter ending March 31,
1994.  The property has been purchased as a site suitable for future
construction of expanded manufacturing, warehouse and corporate office
facilities.

     corporation; to invest the funds of the corporation from time
     to time; and to take and hold any property as security for the

          Clause (b)  Loan to Employees.  To lend money to
     its employees, other than its officers and Directors, and to
     otherwise assist its employees, officers, and Directors; but
     to make no loans secured by the shares of the corporation.

     Section 4.10.  Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  

     (a)  Policy.  It is the policy and intention of the
     corporation to provide to its officers and directors broad and
     comprehensive indemnification from liability to the full
     extent permitted by law.

     (b)  Right to Indemnification.  Each person who was or is a
     party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in
     any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
     administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"),
     by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he
     or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
     officer of the corporation or is or was serving at the request
     of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
     of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
     trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
     employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding
     is an alleged action or inaction in an official capacity or in
     any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
     employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by
     the corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of
     Nevada, as the same exist or may hereafter be amended, against
     all costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses
     (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
     taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
     settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
     connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue
     as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
     employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her
     heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that
     except as provided in paragraph (c) hereof, the corporation
     shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in
     connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
     such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
     authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation.  The
     right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a
     contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the
     corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
     proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,
     however, that, if Nevada law requires, the payment of such
     expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her
     capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other
     capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person
     while a director or officer, including, without limitation,
     service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
     disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery
     to the corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such
     director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
     shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer
     is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or
     otherwise.  The corporation may, by action of its Board of
     Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of
     the corporation with the same scope and effect as the
     foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

     (c)  Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.  If a claim under this
     Article is not paid in full by the corporation, the claimant
     may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation
     to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful
     in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
     also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a
     defense to any such action (other than an action brought to
     enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any
     proceeding advance of its final disposition where the required
     undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
     corporation) that the claimant has failed to meet a standard
     of conduct which makes it permissible under Nevada law for the
     corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. 
     Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of
     Directors, independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) to
     have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
     action that indemnification of the claimant is permissible in
     the circumstances because he or she has met such standard of
     conduct, nor an actual determination by the corporation
     (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel
     or its shareholders) that the claimant has not met such
     standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
     create a presumption that the claimant has failed to meet such
     standard of conduct.

     (d)  Non-Exclusivity of Rights.  The right to indemnification
     and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding
     in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article
     shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may
     have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
     Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of
     shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

     (e)  Insurance.  The corporation may maintain insurance, at
     its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
     employee or agent of the corporation or other corporation,
     partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against
     any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
     corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
     against such expense, liability or loss under Nevada law.

     (f)  Expenses as a Witness.  To the extent that any director,
     officer, employee or agent of the corporation is by reason of
     such position, or a position with another entity at the
     request of the corporation, a witness in any action, suit or
     proceeding, he or she shall be indemnified against all costs
     and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or
     on his or her behalf in connection therewith.

             EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORSHIP AGREEMENT


     AGREEMENT, made and entered into in Reno, Nevada, this ____
day of __________, 1993 between Sodak Gaming Services, a South
Dakota corporation (hereinafter referred to as "SGS"); Mike
Wordeman, an individual; and IGT, 520 South Rock Boulevard, Reno,
Nevada, ("IGT"). 

     IT IS AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

     1.   EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATION FOR SPECIFIC TERRITORY:

          A.  Grant of Territory and Marketing Privileges:  IGT,
subject to the Operating Requirements set forth below and the other
limitations, terms and conditions set forth herein, grants to SGS: 
the sole and exclusive, non-transferable license to purchase for
resale, sell, promote the sale, and distribute IGT Products
lawfully approved for sale in North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming,
and for Native American Reservations located in the 48 contiguous
States (except and excluding Nevada, New Jersey and the non-
contiguous States Hawaii and Alaska) and to Indians, aboriginal
peoples or Native peoples in Provinces of Canada where gaming
activity is approved by the appropriate Canadian entity and Sodak
is licensed or approved to distribute IGT Products.  "IGT Products"
shall mean IGT manufactured or assembled gaming devices, slot
machines, terminals developed and offered by IGT as video terminals
for a lottery, and IGT-distributed gaming machines designed or
manufactured by others.  It is acknowledged and agreed that this
grant does not include, and no rights accrue to SGS hereunder, as
to IGT linked progressive system products, Special Products, or
system management operations conducted in whole or part by IGT; or
to non-gaming applications of IGT Products or Special Products. 
All other distributorship arrangements, agreements or
understandings between the parties, except the Wisconsin and South
Dakota Indian Gaming Interlink Agreement ("Interlink Agreement"),
are herewith fully terminated, including without limitation the
prior agreements of August 10, October 28, 1989, February 5, 1990
and January 21, 1991, and April 28, 1992 and all modifications to
said agreements, it being the intention of the parties that this
Agreement and the Interlink Agreement as amended from time to time
shall be the sole distributorship agreements between the parties.

          B.   Acceptance:  SGS hereby accepts the above exclusive
non-transferable license to sell, distribute, and promote IGT
Products in said territory, as limited, and agrees to use its best
efforts in selling and distributing IGT Products in the territory. 
Further, so long as this Agreement is in force and effect, SGS and
all affiliates of SGS agree that they, and each of them, shall not
anywhere in North America directly or indirectly solicit orders
for, sell, lease, promote the sale or otherwise deal in products
which compete with or are similar to systems or devices
manufactured by IGT.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, SGS may
manufacture, promote the sale of, and distribute specialty
manufactured gaming equipment or supplies as specified in Exhibit
A, attached hereto and incorporated herein, which Exhibit A may be
amended from time to time by written agreement between IGT and SGS. 
As used herein, "affiliate" shall be any company or business entity
of which SGS directly or through a subsidiary owns ten percent
(10%) or more of the outstanding equity interests, or any company,
business entity or person which directly or indirectly holds five
percent (5%) or more of SGS (excluding Promus Corporation) or is an
officer of SGS.

          C.   Specific Reservations:  
                    
               i.   Special Products:  SGS shall, within the
guidelines provided in writing by IGT from time to time, solicit
offers only within the territory for Special Products.  "Special
Products", as used herein, means IGT linked progressive systems,
keno systems, live game systems, non-video lottery systems, and
products not offered for sale by IGT to gaming or government
customers of IGT.  All such offers shall be subject to acceptance
by IGT in its sole discretion.  The parties specifically reserve
the dealings as between IGT and SGS for future negotiations as to
each transaction that presents itself.

               ii.  Special Customers:  Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, IGT may deal directly with any
retail customer where that customer has operations inside and
outside the territory and insists upon dealing with IGT directly. 
In all such instances, SGS shall receive a five percent (5%)
commission rateably as IGT is paid on the actual sales price to IGT
less shipping, taxes and all costs attendant to delivery, which
costs are not reimbursed by such customer to IGT.  In addition to
the referenced five percent (5%) commission, IGT shall pay Sodak on
a prorated basis, that portion of the actual costs incurred by
Sodak as of the date of sale by IGT pursuant to this provision
which is attributable to the development of the state within which
the customer in question is located as a market for IGT Products
[method to be discussed].  It is understood and agreed that Sodak
is not entitled to a commission for any sale or lease of gaming or
lottery equipment to any Provincial Government for use in any
Canadian Province.

               iii. Used Trade-Ins:  SGS agrees it shall observe
the territorial structure of IGT marketing to ensure orderly
distribution of IGT Products.  Should SGS receive used equipment as
trade-ins on new sales of IGT Products, it may sell such used
equipment even if it is not an IGT Product.  If such used equipment
is sold for use outside the territory, SGS agrees to pay no less
than five percent (5%) commission on the sales price of said used
equipment to IGT or the IGT distributor for the location in which
the equipment is to be used.

          D.   Term:  Except as provided in Paragraph 8, this
Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above and continue
for five (5) years.  At the end of said five (5) years, this
Agreement shall continue from year to year upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, unless canceled by either party by
written notice delivered at least ninety (90) days prior to a
proposed termination at the end of said five (5) years or any year
continuance thereafter.

          E.   Models/Display Machines:  IGT may, from time to
time, change the design or specifications for IGT Products and
Special Products and shall designate the specific machine models of
any and all of the machines to be offered to SGS from the entire
range of IGT Products and Special Products licensed by the
applicable licensing body for the specific jurisdiction involved,
during the term of this Agreement.  

          F.   Standard Machine Specifications:  IGT agrees that
all IGT machines provided to SGS shall conform to the
specifications of machines licensed by the appropriate licensing
agency for the destination within the territory which SGS
designates the machines to be bound.  Any change of or addition to
said specifications by SGS shall only be at the prior approval of
IGT and pursuant to changes authorized by said appropriate
governmental agency.  Any change required by governmental authority
having responsibility for the licensure or approval of gaming
machines shall be deemed approved by the parties and shall be a
standard specification to be implemented by SGS and IGT.  Any
change thus required shall be deemed to require a change, as
specifically designated by IGT in its sole discretion, to the list
price otherwise applicable.  Any retrofit shall be at SGS's cost.

          G.   Manufacturer's Limited Warranty:  IGT warrants all
equipment, parts, supplies and accessories to be in satisfactory
operating condition at the time of shipment from Reno, Nevada.  Any
minor repairs, exchanges of parts and adjustments necessary to
maintain satisfactory operating conditions of equipment after
delivery to SGS shall be the responsibility of SGS, except that, in
light of the special circumstances of the distances in the
territory, IGT will replace or repair any IGT part or component
which is defective because of the fault of IGT, PROVIDED these
defective elements are returned to IGT by SGS, shipment at SGS's
expense, within ninety (90) days of shipment from Reno.  THE
WARRANTY STATED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS EXCLUSIVE AND IS IN LIEU OF
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
PURPOSE.  IGT shall not be liable to SGS and/or any customer of SGS
for any claim and/or damages including any labor costs, lost
profits, and/or consequential damages.  IGT shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless SGS from and against any and all claims, demands,
suits, and/or causes of action which arise or have arisen either
directly or indirectly as a result of, or in connection with any
patent or copyright matters as to IGT products or special products,
save and except for machines and devices manufactured by others.

          H.   Price/Payment for IGT Products:

               i.   IGT Products:  IGT shall sell to SGS the IGT
Products (except custom alterations and parts and except Special
Products) at IGT's then current retail list price, as established
by IGT in its sole discretion and provided to SGS from time to time
in writing by IGT, F.O.B. Reno, Nevada, minus twenty-five percent
(25%) as to all IGT Products (except non-Indian Reservation lottery
terminals, which terminals shall be list minus twenty percent
(20%)), plus sales taxes, shipping charges and all costs attendant
to delivery to SGS.  A standard IGT Product is that item which has,
prior to the time of customer order, been designed and released to
production by IGT and designated as available for sale in the
territory.  Anything different from or in addition to a standard
product is a custom alteration.  All custom alterations to IGT's
standard products shall be sold to SGS at IGT's then quoted hourly
rate plus materials minus twenty-five percent (25%). IGT shall
specify custom work prior to acceptance of the purchase order, and
shall provide SGS a written estimate of the custom charges.  SGS
must accept the estimate price in writing before it shall be bound
to purchase the custom alteration.
               
               ii.  Written Orders for IGT Products:  All orders
for IGT Products shall be in writing on forms provided by IGT,
signed by an authorized employee of SGS.  No order by SGS or any of
its employees shall be binding upon IGT until the same is formally
accepted in writing by an authorized employee of IGT at IGT's
office in Reno.  Once accepted by IGT, an order may be canceled or
modified only by mutual consent, subject to payment to IGT by SGS
of expenditures incurred by IGT in connection with the order which
are not reasonably recoverable.  

               iii. Payment by SGS for IGT Products:  Unless
otherwise specified in writing at the time of order, payment in
full by SGS shall be made to IGT for IGT Products and custom
alterations within ninety (90) days from the date of delivery to
the carrier for shipment.  If such payment is made in full within
ninety (90) days, no interest charge shall be applied.  Payment for
IGT orders shall be in U.S. dollars to IGT's Reno office.  As to
sales on other than 90 day terms, payment in full shall be made in
not more than thirty-six (36) equal monthly installments of
principal, pursuant to such terms as is specified by SGS in the
sales order, together with interest at the rate of two percent (2%)
over the prime lending rate as quoted from time to time by First
Interstate Bank, Los Angeles office; prepayment may be made at
anytime without penalty; payment and interest to commence from the
date of delivery to the carrier for shipment.  Any and all amounts
not timely paid shall accrue interest at a default interest rate of
one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance of
principal and accrued interest due.  Payment in full by SGS shall
be secured by an irrevocable standby letter of credit (or other
form of guaranteed payment acceptable to IGT) in an amount up to
fifty percent (50%) of the total outstanding balance due by SGS to
IGT, which amount shall not be less than Six Million Dollars
($6,000,000.00).   The letters of credit shall be in a form
acceptable to IGT, to be drawn against only if payment is not
received by IGT as specified herein.  Said letters of credit shall
be renewed not later than thirty (30) days before expiration, and
IGT may be entitled to draw on existing letters of credit if such
advance renewal is not secured.  SGS shall be fully liable as to
any deficiencies that may remain owed to IGT by SGS after said
letter of credit draw.

          I.   Manufacture and Delivery:  To enable IGT to
establish production schedules and place orders with its suppliers
with adequate lead time, SGS will furnish IGT, unless otherwise
specified by IGT, with monthly estimates of SGS's requirements for
the next three (3) calendar months.  A mutually agreed upon
delivery schedule shall be established for each order.  SGS will
select the mode of transportation provided for all deliveries of
IGT Products hereunder and shall be responsible to carriers for all
charges and costs in effectuating delivery of the IGT Products to
SGS at such places as may be mutually agreed from time-to-time. 
Each and every shipment shall be deemed delivered as of the date of
receipt of delivery at IGT's warehouse docks, at either Reno,
Nevada, by an authorized agent of SGS or the SGS-designated
carrier.

          J.   Risk of Loss:  Whenever IGT shall cause to be
manufactured and shipped any machines, parts, components or
materials for delivery to SGS, the risk of loss shall be on IGT
until actual delivery of said machines to SGS in Reno, Nevada, or
its designated shipper, in Reno, Nevada, at which time the risk of
loss shall pass to SGS; provided, however, that, if a machine,
part, component, or material is returned to IGT pursuant to
warranty herein, the risk of loss shall pass to IGT upon delivery
to an authorized agent of IGT.  

          K.   Independent Status:  All persons hired or employed
by SGS in the discharge of this Agreement shall be considered
employees of SGS and not of IGT and shall be solely and exclusively
under SGS's direction and control.  SGS agrees to obtain and
maintain all business licenses necessary to its business, pay all
applicable taxes and fees, and to employ all salesmen, servicemen
or other persons only under terms by which IGT shall be released in
writing from all indebtedness from SGS to such persons.  SGS
further agrees to have all persons employed by it properly covered
by Workmen's Compensation or Employer's Liability Insurance, as
required by law; and to assume and pay at its own cost all taxes
and contributions required by an employer under any and all
unemployment insurance, old age pensions and other applicable so-
called social security acts.  SGS specifically agrees that it shall
be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and save IGT
harmless from, any and all loss, damage, and costs (including
attorney's fees) that IGT may sustain, or become liable for, by
reason of claims against IGT, on account of the acts of any
employee or agent of SGS.

          L.   Dealer Operating Requirements:  To provide
appropriate representation, and facilitate proper sale and
servicing of IGT Products, Dealer shall establish and maintain
places of business and/or agencies satisfactory to IGT, in its
reasonable judgment, as to facilities, appearance, sales and
service operations, parts inventory, and trained personnel and
capital equipment.  Such facilities shall be sufficiently
established within the territory set forth above to adequately
meet, within IGT's reasonable judgment, the needs of customers
within each jurisdiction for which IGT Products are located within
the said territory.

          M.   Trade Name:  The names IGT, and International Game
Technology, and the names of its products, are registered and/or
are the exclusive property of IGT; and nothing herein contained
shall give to SGS any interest in these names, except the right to
use them during the term of this Agreement in connection with the
lease, operation, service or repair of the machines as provided
herein or applications for necessary permits.  Upon termination of
this Agreement for whatever cause, SGS shall abandon at once the
use of the names IGT, or International Game Technology or any
similar name or colorable imitation, or misleading name.  

          N.   Advertising:  In the event IGT shall supply SGS
advertising material relative to any of its products, SGS shall
display such advertising material as directed by IGT, and in the
absence of instructions, SGS upon receipt of such materials, shall
promptly display them in a conspicuous and prominent manner.

     2.   INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE, PARTS AND SERVICE:

          A.   Purchase of Inventory:  SGS shall maintain, at its
cost, a stock of spare parts adequate to timely meet the needs of
its customers and its obligations under this Agreement.

          B.   Provision for Service:  SGS shall make available and
offer to SGS customers within the territory set forth above through
its own employees or agents, parts and repair service at no cost to
said customers during the first ninety (90) days following
installation for all IGT Products sold or leased in the said
territory.  SGS shall provide installation, parts, and repair
service not covered by the ninety (90) day parts and service
warranty, for all IGT Products and Special Products within the
territory, at such rates and charges as are competitive in the
industry and shall make a good faith effort with such service to
maintain the reputation of IGT, subject to all Foreign, Federal,
State and Local laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations and lawful
requirements of the gaming authorities regarding the engagement in
such services.

          C.   Price of Parts:  Except as provided by warranty
herein and except as to parts specified in writing from time to
time by IGT to SGS for which a designated price to SGS is made, the
price of standard IGT manufactured parts and components, parts
obtained by IGT from other suppliers provided to SGS shall be at
the then IGT retail list price, as determined solely by IGT and
provided in writing to SGS from time to time, minus thirty percent
(30%) of said price.  A standard IGT part is that item which has,
prior to the time of customer order, been designed and released to
production by IGT; anything different from or in addition to a
standard part is a custom alteration; all custom alterations to
IGT's standard parts shall be sold to SGS at IGT's then quoted
hourly rate minus twenty-five percent (25%).  All prices for IGT
parts are F.O.B. Reno, Nevada, to which shall be added applicable
sales tax, shipping and all other costs attendant to delivery to
SGS.

          D.   Method of Order and Payment:  An order for parts or
components shall be in writing specifying the SGS ordering agent,
order number, and sufficiently detailed specifications for
identification of the kind and quantity of the items ordered. 
Payment in full shall be made in full, secured by standby
irrevocable letter of credit or other guaranteed payment acceptable
to IGT, from a bank acceptable to IGT, within ninety (90) days of
the date of delivery to SGS of each part sold to SGS.  If said
payment is not timely made, interest at one and one-half percent
(1.5%) per month shall accrue on the outstanding balance of
principal and accrued interest until paid in full.  Payment for IGT
orders shall be in U.S. Dollars to IGT's Reno, Nevada office. 

          E.   Delivery:  Delivery of parts, components and
materials shall be pursuant to the same terms and conditions as set
forth above for delivery of IGT Products.

     3.   FACILITATION OF SALES AND SERVICE, IGT PROPRIETARY
INTERESTS:  To facilitate said sales service by SGS, IGT agrees to
provide SGS with schematics, wiring diagrams, maintenance and
service manuals, and any other technical material as determined
solely by IGT for appropriate IGT Products, special Products, and
parts as ordered by SGS pursuant to this Agreement.  IGT also
agrees to train SGS technicians, provided SGS pays all expenses and
travel costs incurred in such training.  SGS agrees that the
technical data not available in the normal course of business which
is provided pursuant to this Paragraph and any and all
modifications thereto from whatever party or source constitutes IGT
proprietary information, and SGS, its employees and agents shall
not disclose said information to any third party without the prior
consent of IGT and shall not use such information to the detriment
of IGT or its products.  SGS specifically agrees that all software,
processes, mechanisms, art work, trade names, systems and items
whatsoever created, developed or originated by IGT and any and all
modifications thereto from whatever source are and shall remain the
sole property of IGT.  This Paragraph shall survive termination of
this Agreement for any reason and the parties agree damages are
inadequate to remedy any breach hereof, and that injunctive relief
is appropriate and may be granted by a court of competent
jurisdiction to halt any such breach.

     4.   ADDRESSES:  Any written notice, or offer and reply

1.C. of this Agreement, the Agreement may be terminated as follows:

          A.   By IGT:  IGT may terminate this Agreement as to all
or any part of the territory if:

               i.   Upon ninety (90) days written notice delivered
by IGT to SGS, if any ownership in SGS or control or control
influence over SGS or its successors is held by or passed to any
single person or single business entity which, in the reasonable
belief of IGT, materially jeopardizes any license or approval or
application by IGT or creates a material conflict of interest in
such person or business entity with IGT and its products and such
ownership or control influence is not forthwith removed, or if
Wordeman either fails to maintain a substantial (5% or more)
ownership of SGS or ceases his substantial involvement in the
operation of SGS (including without limitation his resignation or
termination from his positions as President and CEO of SGS) for any
reason other than as a result of his death or total disability,
without the prior written consent of IGT, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.  Stock certificates evidencing at least
five percent (5%) ownership by Wordeman of SGS shall be endorsed
with a restrictive legend prohibiting transfer of said shares
without the prior written consent of IGT; 

               ii.  a.   If in the reasonable belief of IGT, SGS
has failed to maintain ethics, reputation, image, or customer
relations in accordance with Industry standards (including without
limitation, standards applicable to distributors licensed by the
States of Nevada and New Jersey), and such failure is not corrected
within ninety (90) days of receipt from IGT of written notice to
Sodak of the specific nature of said failure and the action
necessary to correct said failure; or

                    b.   SGS has failed to provide its best effort
to attain a reasonable level of sales performance and market or
service from IGT Products or Special Products as to any specific
jurisdiction within the territory, and such failure is not
corrected within ninety (90) days of receipt from IGT of written
notice to Sodak of the specific nature of said failure and the
action necessary to correct said failure; or  

                    c.   If SGS has directly or indirectly offered
any non-IGT Products which directly compete with IGT Products or
IGT Special Products to the extent such activity is prohibited by
Paragraph 1.B of this Agreement and if such activity is not
corrected by Sodak within ninety (90) days of receipt from IGT of
written notice by Sodak of the nature of the activity and the
action necessary to correct said failure; or

                    d.   If SGS has failed to comply with written
IGT policies or procedures delivered to Sodak which shall be
reasonable and consistent with industry norms if such failure has
materially affected the ability of Sodak to perform its obligations
imposed pursuant to this Agreement and if such failure is not
corrected by Sodak within ninety (90) days of receipt from IGT of
written notice by Sodak of the nature of said failure and the
action necessary to correct said failure; or

                    e.   If SGS has failed to establish and
maintain sufficient facilities as to any specific jurisdiction
within the territory, if such failure has materially affected the
ability of Sodak to perform its obligations imposed pursuant to
this Agreement and such failure is not corrected to the
satisfaction of IGT within a reasonable time following receipt of
written notice to Sodak of the specific nature of said failure and
the action necessary to correct said failure; or
               
          B.   By Sodak:  Upon written notice delivered to IGT,
Sodak may terminate this Agreement if:

               i.   In the reasonable belief of Sodak, a material
defect or condition is contained within a significant number of IGT
Products which render those products noncompetitive in the
marketplace, or not fit for the use intended, and which defect or
condition is not corrected within a reasonable time giving due
regard to the nature of the defect.
          
          C.   By Either Party:  Upon written notice delivered to
the other party, if:

               i.   The other party has failed to observe all
applicable laws or obtain any necessary license or approval from
each gaming regulatory authority in each applicable jurisdiction
within the territory; and such failure materially affects the
performance of such other party or could materially affect the
complaining party in its business elsewhere.  In the event of the
inability of Sodak to obtain a license or approval in a
jurisdiction within the territory does not materially affect IGT's
business elsewhere and if the failure is not corrected by Sodak
within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice by Sodak of the nature
of the failure, IGT may terminate the right of Sodak to distribute
only in that jurisdiction within the territory;

               ii.  The other party becomes insolvent, or files a
petition for adjudication as bankrupt or insolvent, or executes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or has a receiver
appointed for it for any reason; or

               iii. The other party materially breaches this
Agreement.

     9.   EFFECT OF TERMINATION: OBLIGATION OF THE PARTIES:  Upon
the termination of this Agreement for any reason, the rights of
each to payment on account of the sale of equipment or services
already performed when this Agreement was in effect shall not be
impaired.  Upon such termination, each party shall cooperate with
the other to effect a smooth termination, with minimum economic
harm to each party and with regard to the best interests of
customers, and to reimburse the other in a commercially reasonable
fashion for any expenses incurred by it at the request of the first
party.  Upon the termination of this Agreement, SGS will turn over
to IGT copies of all records relating to proprietary information,
confidential information, service activities on IGT Products and
Special Products.  Further, upon termination, either party, subject
to the proprietary rights set forth above, shall have the right to
develop, manufacture and sell, lease or otherwise distribute or
operate any and all products in the territory.    

     10.  GAMING LAWS:  This Agreement is intended to only
authorize and facilitate the sale, service, and/or distribution of
slot machines and related products in a lawful manner, and is
subject to and conditioned upon all applicable Federal, state and
local laws dealing with such machines.  This Agreement shall not be
deemed to require or authorize any act or transaction except as may
be in full compliance with all such legal requirements.  It is
specifically agreed by SGS that it shall scrupulously observe all
applicable federal, state and tribal laws relating to the
activities contemplated by this Agreement.  This Agreement and the
rights of the parties shall be construed in accordance with the law
of the State of Nevada.  Each party hereto agrees to take all
lawful actions necessary and make every lawful effort to procure
and maintain all required Foreign, Federal, State and local
licenses and approvals for compliance with such legal requirements.

          A.   IGT agrees that it shall pay all costs of licensing
proceedings, governmental investigation and approval required by
Foreign, Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, ordinances or
statutes as to IGT, its stockholders, agents, employees or assigns
and as to IGT-offered slot and/or any modifications, components,
parts or materials of IGT-offered slot machines.


          B.   SGS agrees that it shall, at no cost to IGT, take
all necessary actions as liaison between IGT and governmental
authorities to coordinate and facilitate governmental investigation
of IGT-offered machines, including facilitation of location testing
of such machines, if such is required.

          C.   SGS agrees that it shall pay all costs of licensing
proceedings, governmental investigations, and approval required by
Foreign, Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, ordinances or
statutes as to SGS, its stockholders, agents, employees or assigns.

     11.  FORCE MAJEURE: IGT shall not be liable for any
commissions or damages resulting from failure to accept or fill any
order or orders for IGT Products, Special Products, or parts
hereunder, either in whole or in part, when any such failure shall
be due to any one or more of the following causes:  orders or
instructions issued by representatives of the governments of the
United States or Australia, or of any state, territory or district
of the United States or Australia, or of any municipality, or other
political or governmental division of any such state, territory or
district, or on account of IGT's inability to make complete
deliveries of all of its contracts because of the scarcity of labor
or materials used in manufacturing its products, or on account of
fires, strikes, lockouts, differences with workmen, accidents to
machinery, or orders, decrees or judgments of any court, or any
cause not within the direct control of IGT after a good faith
effort.

to be made by Summit to IGT at closing as provided herein and to
make provision regarding certain dividends of King's Casino

C.   The parties desire, to amend Section 10 of the Agreement to
reflect the understanding of the parties regarding repayment of
that certain Equipment Financing Agreement and Revolving Note,
pursuant to the terms of the CMS/IGT Substituted Note.

     In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the
parties agree as follows:

1.   Name Change.  Each and every reference in the Agreement to

3.   Reduction of Purchase Price.  The parties agree that the
purchase price for the Common Stock of CMS shall be reduced by
reducing the principal balance of the Summit Note (formerly the

thousand five hundred twenty-nine dollars ($2,842,529.00) to two
million forty-two thousand five hundred twenty-nine dollars
($2,042,529.00).  The parties agree that each and every reference

be changed in accordance with the reduction of the principal
balance as set forth in the preceding sentence.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the parties agree that
any and all dividends or other distribution paid or payable by
Kings Casino, Limited from the date of the Agreement through the
closing of the Agreement shall be paid to CMS and shall be held by

the Agreement relating to a change of condition of King's Casino
Limited, including without limitation, objection pursuant to
Section 8.7 of the Agreement.

4.   Equipment Revolving Note.  Section 10 of the Agreement is
hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:
  
     "10.  CMS/IGT Substituted Note.  At closing, IGT agrees
     to cause CMS to make, and IGT shall accept, a promissory
     note in the form attached as Exhibit "Q" (the "CMS/IGT
