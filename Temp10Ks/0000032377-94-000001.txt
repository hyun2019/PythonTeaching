                              Elizabethtown Gas Company

                          Annual Report on Form 10-K For The
                         Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 1993



                                        PART I

     Item 1. Business

          Elizabethtown Gas Company ("Elizabethtown" or the "Company") is
     engaged primarily in the distribution of natural gas and currently serves
     more than 319,000 customers in New Jersey and Florida. Elizabethtown,
     which was organized in 1855, operates with two divisions: The New Jersey
     Division, that does business as Elizabethtown Gas Company, and the Florida
     Division, that does business as City Gas Company of Florida. The Company
     is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NUI Corporation ("NUI"), an exempt public
     utility holding company that was incorporated in New Jersey in 1969. See
     "-Business Plan" and "-The Planned Mergers."

     Business Plan

          The Company, in accordance with the NUI business plan, is
     concentrating on customer growth and the profitability of its gas
     distribution business. Growth opportunities could include the acquisition
     of additional gas distribution companies, the development of new
     franchises and the management of certain service requirements of other
     utilities on a contract basis. The Company's strategy involves assembling,
     as opportunities become available, a natural gas distribution system in
     several states, while maintaining a balanced capital structure. From time
     to time, the Company reviews acquisition opportunities and, when
     requested, submits acquisition proposals.

          The Company's plan takes advantage of opportunities presented by the
     restructuring of interstate natural gas pipeline operations and the
     increase in supply alternatives. Traditionally, interstate pipelines were
     wholesalers of natural gas to local distribution companies and generally
     did not provide separate transportation or other services for specific
     customers. In 1985, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC")
     adopted Order No. 436 that encouraged interstate pipelines to make
     transportation of gas available to customers on a non-discriminatory
     basis. Such voluntary "open access" by certain interstate pipelines
     enhanced the opportunity for the Company, other local gas distribution
     companies and industrial customers to purchase natural gas directly from
     gas producers and others. In 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 that,
     among other things, mandated the separation or "unbundling" of interstate
     pipeline sales, transportation and storage services and established
     guidelines for capacity management effective in 1993. Order No. 636
     increased the opportunity for local gas distribution companies and
     industrial customers to purchase natural gas from alternative sources,
     while increasing the potential business and regulatory risk borne by a
     local gas distribution company with respect to the acquisition and
     management of natural gas services.

          The business plan envisions a natural gas distribution system in
     which, among other matters, local managements conduct the marketing,


                                       1 <PAGE>


     customer service and distribution operations in each state served, with
     management of gas supply and access to capital markets coordinated
     centrally.

          Pursuant to the business plan, NUI spun-off its non-utility
     businesses to its shareholders and acquired City Gas Company of Florida
     which it merged into Elizabethtown in 1988. In 1990, NUI entered into a
     merger agreement with Pennsylvania Enterprises, Inc., which conducts
     natural gas and water utility operations in northeastern Pennsylvania,
     which merger agreement subsequently was terminated. The Company acquired
     additional gas utility service areas in Florida in 1991, adding
     approximately 6,100 customers. In fiscal 1993, the Company expanded its
     Florida operations by initiating natural gas service in St. Lucie County
     (see "-Territory and Customers Served-Florida Division") and NUI entered
     into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Pennsylvania & Southern Gas
     Company ("PSGS") (see "-The Planned Mergers").

          There can be no assurances that the Company will acquire any
     additional gas distribution properties, develop new franchises or manage
     the gas supply requirements of other companies and, if such actions are
     taken, there can be no assurances that they will accomplish the purposes
     described above.

     The Planned Mergers

          On July 27, 1993, NUI and PSGS entered into an Agreement and Plan of
     Merger, pursuant to which PSGS would be merged with and into NUI (the
     "PSGS Merger"). Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, NUI will acquire
     all of the outstanding common shares of PSGS for approximately $17
     million, payable in shares of NUI Common Stock equivalent to $71.50 per
     PSGS share, except that each shareholder will receive no less than 2.4 and
     no more than 3.0 shares of NUI Common Stock for each PSGS share held. The
     exchange value of the NUI Common Stock will be established over the twenty
     day trading period immediately prior to the PSGS Merger. The PSGS Merger
     will be consummated upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals, the
     approval of the stockholders of PSGS and the satisfaction or waiver of
     certain other consents and conditions. Upon the effectiveness of the PSGS
     Merger, NUI would assume all of the rights and obligations of PSGS.
     Following the PSGS Merger, Elizabethtown will be merged with and into NUI
     (the "Elizabethtown Merger"). The PSGS Merger, which will result in
     approximately a seven percent increase in the number of customers served,
     and the Elizabethtown Merger, through which NUI will become an operating
     utility company with three divisions providing gas service in six states,
     fit within the business plan (see "-Business Plan").

     Territory and Customers Served

          See "Selected Financial Data-Summary Consolidated Operating Data" for
     summary information by customer class with respect to operating revenues,
     gas volumes sold or transported and customers served. The Company serves
     more than 319,000 customers, of which approximately 72% are in New Jersey
     and approximately 28% are in Florida. Approximately 51% of the Company's
     customers are residential and commercial customers in New Jersey that
     purchase gas primarily for space heating. The Company's operating revenues
     for fiscal 1993 amounted to $354.9 million, of which approximately 84%
     were generated in New Jersey and approximately 16% were generated in
     Florida. Gas throughput volumes sold or transported in fiscal 1993


                                       2 <PAGE>


     amounted to 71,688,000 Mcf, of which approximately 87% was sold or
     transported in New Jersey and approximately 13% was sold or transported in
     Florida. An Mcf is a basic unit of measurement for natural gas comprising
     1,000 cubic feet of gas.

          In fiscal 1993, the Company's largest single customer, a 614 megawatt
     cogeneration facility in New Jersey, accounted for approximately 7% of
     operating revenues and approximately 11% of total gas sold or transported.
     In fiscal 1993, total throughput for electric generation, including
     cogeneration, accounted for approximately 14% of operating revenues and
     approximately 26% of total gas sold or transported. 

          New Jersey Division. The Company, through its New Jersey Division,
     provides gas service to approximately 231,000 customers in franchised
     territories within seven counties, or portions thereof, in central and
     northwestern New Jersey. The New Jersey Division's 1,300 square-mile
     service territory has a total population of approximately 950,000. Most of
     the New Jersey Division's customers are located in densely-populated
     central New Jersey, where increases in the number of customers are
     primarily from conversions to gas heating from alternative forms of
     heating systems.

          The New Jersey Division's gas volumes sold or transported and
     customers served for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

          Approximately 70% of the residential heating customers added in New
     Jersey since October 1, 1990 represented homes that were converted to gas
     heating from other forms of space heating and the remainder consisted of
     new homes. The reduction in residential non-heating customers principally
     reflects conversions to full gas heating service. As the pool of
     conversion candidates among existing non-heating customers declines, the


                                       3 <PAGE>


     Company is increasing its marketing emphasis with respect to heating
     system conversions in homes and businesses that do not currently have any
     natural gas service. Although new residential construction was slow over
     the past several years, the pace of growth in new residential construction
     starts has increased recently in the New Jersey Division's northwest
     service area.

          The Company has increased its marketing emphasis on commercial
     conversions and is supporting local economic development groups to attract
     new businesses within its service territory. The Company has proposed an
     economic development program to help spur economic growth and jobs
     creation. The program, which is subject to regulatory approval, would
     provide grants and reduced rates for qualifying businesses that start up,
     relocate or expand within designated areas.

          In fiscal 1993, approximately 13 schools and 360 businesses and
     housing complexes, which are subject to New Jersey legislation requiring
     the registration, systematic testing and monitoring of underground fuel
     oil and propane storage tanks, converted to gas heating systems and/or
     switched from interruptible service to firm service. School conversions
     totaled approximately 24 in fiscal 1992 and 50 in fiscal 1991. Business
     and housing complex conversions totaled approximately 439 in fiscal 1992
     and 350 in fiscal 1991. In addition, changing economic conditions, coupled
     with environmental concerns and legislation, are creating a market for
     natural gas for large commercial air conditioning units and compressed
     natural gas fleet vehicles.

          The Company provides gas sales and transportation service comprising
     twenty percent of the primary fuel requirements of a 614 megawatt
     cogeneration facility that began commercial operation in New Jersey in
     July 1992 to supply electric power for New York City. The Company's gas
     supply contracts with certain large cogeneration customers, including the
     614 megawatt facility, allow the Company under certain conditions to take
     back gas service to satisfy peak load requirements (see "-Gas Supply and
     Operations"). The Company is authorized by the New Jersey Board of
     Regulatory Commissioners (the "NJBRC") to retain approximately $2.3
     million of the operating margins that are realized from sales to the 614
     megawatt facility over approximately four years, of which $0.6 million was
     realized in fiscal 1993 and $0.5 million was realized in fiscal 1992. The
     margins that otherwise would be realized on gas sold or transported to the
     facility are used to reduce gas costs charged to firm customers. 

          The decreases with respect to firm industrial customers served, which
     generate revenues from the sale of gas, principally reflect conversions to
     transportation service, which continues to generate revenues for the
     Company from the transportation of customer-owned gas. The rate charged to
     transportation customers is less than the rate charged to firm industrial
     customers because the transportation customer rate does not include any
     cost of gas component; however, the operating margins from both rates are
     substantially the same. See "-Business Plan" and "-Competition."

          The New Jersey Division's "interruptible" customers have alternative
     energy sources and use gas on an "as available" basis. Variations in the
     volume of gas sold or transported to these customers do not have a
     significant direct effect on the Company's earnings because, in accordance
     with New Jersey regulatory requirements, from 90% to 95% of the margins
     that otherwise would be realized on gas sold or transported to


                                       4 <PAGE>


     interruptible customers is used to reduce gas costs charged to firm
     customers.

          The increase in the number of transportation customers principally
     reflects customers converting from industrial sales service, as well as
     the addition of new customers. See "-Business Plan" and "-Competition."

          In November 1993, the NJBRC issued guidelines which are designed to
     provide for the unbundling of natural gas transportation and sales
     services to commercial and industrial customers. Under these guidelines
     the Company is required to file new tariffs for its New Jersey Division by
     April 1, 1994. The Company expects the effect of the new tariffs to be
     neutral to the operating revenues and margins of the Company.

          Florida Division. The Company, through its Florida Division, is the
     second largest natural gas utility in Florida and it supplies gas to
     approximately 88,000 customers in Dade and Broward Counties in south
     Florida and in Brevard County on the central east coast of Florida, among
     the fastest growing areas in the state. The Company initiated natural gas
     service in fiscal 1993 to the city of Port St. Lucie in St. Lucie County.
     Also, in fiscal 1993, the Company entered into a contract with the

     The Florida Division's service areas cover approximately 1,000 square
     miles and have a population of approximately 500,000. 

          The Florida Division's gas volumes sold or transported and customers
     served for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

          The Florida Division's residential customers purchase gas primarily
     for water heating, cooking and clothes drying. Some customers also
     purchase gas to provide space heating during the relatively mild winter
     season. Customer growth principally reflects new construction. The market
     for new residential construction in the counties served by the Florida


                                       5 <PAGE>


     Division has been expanding. The Company estimates that operating margins
     for the Florida Division were lower by $0.5 million in fiscal 1993 because
     of losses suffered by its customers in south Dade County, Florida, in
     August 1992 as a result of Hurricane Andrew. As of September 30, 1993,
     approximately 2,000 of the customers previously served in the affected
     area have not rebuilt, and may not rebuild, homes that were damaged in the
     storm.

          In fiscal 1993, the Company initiated natural gas service to the city
     of Port St. Lucie in St. Lucie County through the construction of a gate
     station interconnection with the interstate pipeline system, acquisition
     and conversion of an existing underground propane system and the extension
     of mains through the city center. The Company expects significant growth
     from this start-up investment.

          The project to serve KSC, the first of a three-phase Company project
     to expand service in Brevard County, will entail a 25 mile pipeline
     extension at an estimated cost of $5 million to be incurred principally in
     fiscal 1994, upon obtaining all required environmental permits. The
     Company expects to expend an additional $10 million over the next 10 years
     to complete the final two phases of the main extension and looping
     project, which will provide access to additional residential, commercial,
     industrial and government customers in the Cape Canaveral, Merritt Island
     and Cocoa Beach areas.

          In February 1991, the Company acquired certain assets of two small
     gas companies in Dade County. This acquisition had the effect of adding
     approximately 6,100 customers.

          Under energy conservation programs approved by the Florida Public
     Service Commission (the "FPSC") that are designed to offset the growth of
     Florida's demand for electricity, the Florida Division is allowed to
     provide cash allowances to builders for natural gas piping and venting
     upon the installation of water heaters, ranges, clothes dryers and heating
     systems in new single family and multi-family dwellings. The programs also
     allow the Florida Division to provide cash allowances to customers who
     replace certain electric appliances with natural gas appliances. The
     Florida Division is allowed to recover the expenses of the energy
     conservation programs in its rates. Pursuant to the rate case concluded in
     August 1991, the Company is allowed to include in rate base certain
     additional costs for natural gas piping and venting under the Company's
     house piping program.

          The Florida Division's commercial customers consist primarily of
     schools, businesses and public facilities, the number of which tends to
     increase concurrently with the continuing growth in population within the
     Florida Division's service areas.

          The Florida Division's industrial customers and certain commercial
     customers are served under tariffs applicable to "interruptible"
     customers. The Company retains all of the operating margins generated on
     sales to these customers as these volumes are included in the allocation
     of the Florida Division's revenue requirements for ratemaking purposes.

          One industrial customer has converted its Florida Division service
     from a sales basis to a transportation basis and the Company has added a
     customer that purchases transportation service. The Florida Division's


                                       6 <PAGE>


     transportation tariff provides margins on transportation services that are
     substantially the same as margins earned on gas sales.

     Gas Supply and Operations

          In 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 that, among other things,
     mandated the separation or "unbundling" of interstate pipeline sales,
     transportation and storage services and established guidelines for
     capacity management effective in 1993. The Company's principal pipeline
     suppliers for its New Jersey Division have offered some open access
     transportation services since the issuance of FERC Order No. 436 in 1985.
     Accordingly, while the implementation of Order No. 636 involves the
     restructuring of the Company's contracts with all of its pipeline
     suppliers, the most significant restructuring pertains to certain
     pipelines that together deliver less than one-third of the Company's total
     firm gas supply. The transition to Order No. 636 has the effect of
     increasing the opportunity for local gas distribution companies and
     industrial customers to purchase natural gas from alternative sources,
     while increasing the potential business and regulatory risk borne by a
     local gas distribution company with respect to the acquisition and
     management of natural gas services (see "-Business Plan"). 

          The Company endeavors to utilize its pipeline capacity efficiently by
     matching capacity to its load profile to the extent feasible. To this end,
     the Company has had a broad unbundled service tariff in effect in New
     Jersey since 1987. The Company continues to avail itself of opportunities
     to improve the utilization of its pipeline capacity by pursuing broad
     based customer growth, including off peak markets, and utilizing capacity
     release provisions within Order 636 when operationally feasible.

          Under Order No. 636 the pipeline companies are passing through to
     their customers transition costs associated with mandated restructuring,
     such as costs resulting from buying out unmarketable gas purchase
     contracts. The transition costs charged to the Company have amounted to
     approximately $1.4 million and are being recovered through the Company's
     gas adjustment clauses. The total amount of such transition costs that
     ultimately may be charged to the Company is not yet determinable. 

          The Company has long-term gas delivery contracts with seven
     interstate pipeline companies. Under these contracts, the Company has a
     right to delivery, on a firm year-round basis, of up to 74.2 million Mcf
     of natural gas annually with a maximum of approximately 237,000 Mcf per
     day. Both the price and conditions of service of these contracts are
     regulated by the FERC. 

          In addition, the Company has six long-term gas purchase contracts for
     the supply of natural gas for its system, including one with an interstate
     pipeline company, three with gas marketers and two with independent
     producers. Under these contracts, the Company has a right to purchase, on
     a firm year-round basis, up to 43.1 million Mcf of natural gas annually
     with a maximum of approximately 139,000 Mcf per day. In addition, the
     Company has access to spot market gas through the interstate pipeline
     system to supplement or replace, on a short-term basis, portions of its
     long-term gas purchase contracts when such actions can reduce overall gas
     costs or are necessary to supply interruptible customers. 




                                       7 <PAGE>


          The Company's gas supply during fiscal 1993, came from the following
     sources: approximately 27% from purchases under contracts with primary
     pipeline suppliers and additional purchases under their filed tariffs;
     approximately 73% from purchases from various producers and gas marketers,
     purchases under long-term contracts with independent producers and owned
     production; and less than 1% from propane and liquefied natural gas
     ("LNG"). The Company manages its gas supply portfolio so as to assure a
     diverse, reliable and secure supply of natural gas at the lowest
     reasonable cost. In fiscal 1993, the Company's largest single supplier
     accounted for 18% of the Company's total gas purchases.

          In order to have available sufficient quantities of gas during the
     New Jersey heating season, the Company stores gas during non-peak periods
     and purchases supplemental gas, including propane, LNG and gas available
     under contracts with certain large cogeneration customers, as it deems
     necessary. The storage contracts provide the Company with an aggregate of
     12.0 million Mcf natural gas storage capacity and provide the Company with
     the right to receive a maximum daily quantity of 150,400 Mcf. The
     contracts with cogeneration customers provide 35,800 Mcf of daily gas
     supply to meet peak loads by allowing the Company to take back capacity
     and supply that otherwise is dedicated to serve those customers. 

          The Company's peak load facilities in New Jersey include a
     propane-air plant with a daily production capacity of 27,400 Mcf, fixed
     propane storage totaling 674,000 gallons and rail car sidings capable of
     storing an additional 300,000 gallons. The Company has an LNG storage and
     vaporization facility with a daily delivery capacity of 24,300 Mcf and
     storage capacity of 131,000 Mcf. 

          The Company owns working interests in gas production from certain gas
     wells in New York State. Gas reserves subject to recovery under an
     existing rate order applicable to the New Jersey Division are
     approximately 250,000 Mcf as of September 30, 1993.

          The Company's maximum daily sendout in fiscal 1993 was approximately
     329,500 Mcf for its New Jersey Division and approximately 39,700 Mcf for
     its Florida Division. The Company maintains sufficient gas supply and
     delivery capacity for a maximum daily sendout capacity for the New Jersey
     Division of approximately 380,500 Mcf and the Florida Division of
     approximately 53,200 Mcf. 

          Certain of the Company's long-term contracts for the supply, storage
     and delivery of natural gas include fixed charges that amount to
     approximately $64 million annually, of which approximately $43 million is
     associated with pipeline delivery contracts. The Company currently
     recovers, and expects to continue to recover, such fixed charges through
     its gas adjustment clauses. The Company also is committed to purchase, at
     market-related prices, minimum quantities of gas that, in the aggregate,
     are approximately 7 million Mcf per year or to pay certain costs in the
     event the minimum quantities are not taken. The Company expects that
     minimum demand on its systems will continue to exceed these minimum
     purchase obligations.

          In accordance with a settlement approved by the NJBRC, the Company
     recovers through rates charged by its New Jersey Division the costs
     (exclusive of carrying costs) of surcharges from its pipeline suppliers
     that relate to take-or-pay obligations that the suppliers had with natural


                                       8 <PAGE>


     gas producers. See "Commitments and Contingencies," Note 8 of the Notes to
     the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

          The Company distributes gas through approximately 2,600 miles of
     steel, cast iron and plastic mains in New Jersey and approximately 2,350
     miles of steel and plastic mains in Florida. The Company has physical
     interconnections with four interstate pipelines in New Jersey and with the
     sole interstate pipeline in Florida.

     Regulation 

          Elizabethtown is subject to regulation with respect to, among other
     matters, rates, service, accounting and the issuance of securities. The
     New Jersey Division is regulated by the NJBRC. The Florida Division is
     regulated by the FPSC. The Company is also subject to regulation by the
     United States Department of Transportation under the Natural Gas Pipeline
     Safety Act of 1968 with respect to the design, installation, testing,
     construction and maintenance of pipeline facilities. Natural gas
     purchases, transportation service and storage service provided to the
     Company by interstate pipeline companies are subject to regulation by the
     FERC. See "-Gas Supply and Operations."

          The Company's current rates and tariffs for its New Jersey Division
     reflect a rate case that was settled in October 1991, under which the
     Company obtained a weather normalization clause and reduced its rates by
     an amount equivalent to $500,000 in annual revenues. The weather
     normalization clause, which is designed to help stabilize the Company's
     results by increasing amounts charged to customers when weather has been
     warmer than normal and by decreasing amounts charged when weather has been
     colder than normal, was initially adopted on a two-year test basis and has
     been extended through fiscal 1994. Revenue adjustments pursuant to the
     weather normalization clause increased the Company's operating margins by
     $1.3 million in fiscal 1993 and by $0.8 million in fiscal 1992. The New
     Jersey rate case settlement reflected a rate base amounting to
     approximately $184 million with an allowed overall return of 11.3%, which
     would allow the Company the opportunity to earn a 12.4% return on New
     Jersey Division utility equity. The Company had filed its application for
     a rate change for its New Jersey Division, including the weather
     normalization clause, in December 1990 and had requested an increase in
     rates equivalent to $11.5 million in annual revenues. The Company reduced
     its revenue requirements after the application was filed, reflecting cost
     reductions, the expected effect on the cost of capital from a
     tax-advantaged financing (see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
     Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financing Activities and
     Resources") and other factors.

          The Company had previously increased its New Jersey Division's rates
     in February 1990 by an amount equivalent to $3.5 million in annual
     revenues, pursuant to a rate order issued by the NJBRC. The Company had
     requested an increase in rates equivalent to $13 million in annual
     revenues when it had filed its application to the NJBRC in December 1988
     for a rate change.

          In November 1993, the NJBRC issued guidelines which are designed to
     provide for unbundling of natural gas transportation and sales services to
     commercial and industrial customers. Under these guidelines the Company is
     required to file new tariffs for its New Jersey Division by April 1, 1994.


                                       9 <PAGE>


     The Company expects the effect of the new tariffs to be neutral to the
     operating revenues and margins of the Company.

          The Company's current rates and tariffs for its Florida Division
     reflect a rate case that was settled in August 1991, under which the
     Company increased its rates by an amount equivalent to $3.5 million in
     annual revenues. A portion of this increase, equivalent to $2.5 million
     annually, was being billed on an interim basis since July 1990. The
     Florida rate case settlement reflected a rate base amounting to
     approximately $63 million with an allowed overall return of 9.47%, which
     would allow the Company the opportunity to earn a 13.0% return on Florida
     Division utility equity. 

          In response to an initiative by the FPSC, several Florida natural gas
     utilities agreed in November 1993 to reduce the return allowed on their
     utility equity to either 11% or 11.25%. The Company expects to agree to a
     reduction in its allowed return on equity; however, it expects the allowed
     return, as adjusted, to exceed the return it is actually achieving.
     Therefore, the Company expects that the adjustment will not affect
     operating revenues and margins.

          The Company's rates for its utility operations are based on
     recovering the cost of service for those operations, which, among other
     factors, provides for a return on utility equity. When the Company applies
     for rate adjustments, it estimates its cost of service based on certain
     historical costs and pro forma adjustments for known and measurable
     changes. As the rate case progresses, the estimates may change as more
     information becomes available. Accordingly, the rates that are determined
     upon the conclusion of the rate case generally will be different than
     those reflected in the application.

          The Company's tariffs contain adjustment clauses that enable the
     Company to recover purchased gas costs. The adjustment clauses provide for
     periodic reconciliation of recoverable gas costs with applicable amounts
     billed. Under or over recovery at the reconciliation date is recovered
     from or refunded to customers in subsequent periods. See "-Gas Supply and
     Operations."

     Capital Expenditures

          Capital expenditures, which consist primarily of expenditures to
     expand and upgrade the Company's gas distribution systems, were
     $39.6 million in fiscal 1993, $31.3 million in fiscal 1992 and
     $24.8 million in fiscal 1991. Approximately $58.6 million of these capital
     expenditures were for construction relating to new customers and
     additional distribution, storage and other gas plant facilities. The
     Company's capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $48.0
     million in fiscal 1994, including approximately $30.7 million for system
     expansion. In addition, the net present value of minimum lease payments
     relating to noncancelable operating leases, which relate principally to
     New Jersey Division office space, is approximately $23.0 million as of
     September 30, 1993, including $3.0 million payable in fiscal 1994.

     Seasonal Aspects

          Sales of gas to some classes of customers are affected by variations
     in demand due to changes in weather conditions, including normal seasonal


                                      10 <PAGE>


     variations throughout the year. The demand for gas for heating purposes is
     closely related to the severity of the winter heating season. Seasonal
     variations affect short-term cash requirements.

     Persons Employed

          As of September 30, 1993, the Company employed 1,011 persons. As of
     September 30, 1993, the Utility Workers Union of America (Local 424)
     represented 299 employees of the New Jersey Division. The current labor
     contract with Local 424 expires on November 20, 1994. It was approved by
     the bargaining unit in December 1990 following a 24-day work stoppage
     which began upon the expiration of the previous contract. As of September
     30, 1993, the Teamsters Union represented 118 employees of the Florida
     Division under a contract which expires March 31, 1997.

          In July 1990, the Company offered eligible employees a one-time
     opportunity to elect early retirement with special incentives. Twenty-five
     New Jersey Division employees retired in January 1991 pursuant to the
     plan.

     Competition

          The Company competes with distributors of other fuels and forms of
     energy, including electricity, fuel oil and propane, in all portions of
     the territories served. Electricity and oil are the primary competition to
     natural gas in the residential and commercial markets where the primary
     uses of energy are for space heating, water heating, cooking and clothes
     drying. In recent years, natural gas has enjoyed a competitive price
     advantage over electricity and oil for such purposes, which continues to
     allow the Company to obtain a significant share of the residential and
     commercial sectors of the new construction market. The number of
     residential, commercial and industrial conversions has accelerated
     recently due to concerns and legislation regarding underground oil storage
     tanks. See "-Territory and Customers Served."

          In addition, open access to the interstate pipeline transmission
     systems (see "-Business Plan") allows certain industrial customers to
     purchase gas from alternative sources for transportation through the
     Company's distribution systems and may allow certain industrial customers
     to bypass the Company's systems altogether by connecting directly to a gas
     pipeline. The Company seeks to remain competitive in the industrial
     markets through flexible tariffs.

     Franchises

          The Company holds non-exclusive municipal franchises and other
     consents which enable it to provide natural gas in the territories it
     serves. The Company intends to renew these franchises and consents as they
     expire.

     Environment

          The Company is subject to federal and state legislation with respect
     to water, air quality, solid waste disposal and employee health and safety
     matters and to environmental regulations issued by the United States
     Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), the New Jersey Department of



                                      11 <PAGE>


     Environmental Protection and Energy (the "NJDEPE"), and other federal and
     state agencies.

          The Company owns, or previously owned, certain properties on which
     gas was manufactured by the New Jersey Division or by other parties in the
     past. Coal tar residues are present on six of these sites and the Company
     has reported their presence to the EPA, the NJDEPE and the NJBRC. In April
     1991, the NJDEPE issued an Administrative Consent Order that establishes
     the procedures to be followed by the Company in the development of its
     remediation plan for the site on South Street in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
     Subsequently, the Company and the NJDEPE entered into Memoranda of
     Agreement that establish procedures for the development of investigation
     and remediation plans for the other five sites.

          The Company expects it will expend in the next twenty years
     approximately $25 million, net of approximately $6 million that the
     Company estimates will be borne by the prior owner and operator of certain
     of the sites, to complete investigation of such sites and the remediation
     of the coal tar contamination. The Company, with the assistance of an
     outside consulting firm, determined the estimated expenditure by assessing
     the cost of (1) obtaining additional required data about each site and (2)
     the applicable remedial action, among those currently known, that is most
     appropriate for each site. The ultimate costs will depend upon the
     investigation and remediation plans that finally are adopted by the
     Company, subject to the approval of the NJDEPE, and may be less or greater
     than the Company's current estimate. The Company has an accrual of
     approximately $25 million for investigation and remediation of the sites
     and the related costs have been deferred on its Consolidated Balance
     Sheet.

          The Company believes that its remediation costs will be recoverable
     in rates and that a portion of such costs may be recoverable from the
     Company's insurance carriers. The current base rate order for the New
     Jersey Division permits the Company to utilize full deferred accounting
     for coal tar related expenditures, which amounted to approximately $0.8
     million in fiscal 1993 and $0.6 million in fiscal 1992. The current base
     rate order provides for the recovery through rates at $130,000 annually of
     coal tar related expenditures incurred prior to the rate order. Other New
     Jersey utilities also have received authorization to recover similar
     environmental expenditures in rates.

     Item 2. Properties

          The Company owns approximately 2,600 miles of steel, cast iron and
     plastic gas mains in New Jersey, together with city gate stations, gas
     holders and peak shaving plants, including an LNG storage facility in
     Elizabeth, New Jersey. In addition, the Company owns approximately 2,350
     miles of steel and plastic mains in Florida, as well as gate stations,
     meters and related equipment. The assets of the Florida Division are
     subject to the lien of a mortgage securing $11.6 million of indebtedness.

          The Company also owns real property in Union, Middlesex, Warren,
     Sussex and Hunterdon Counties in New Jersey and in Dade, Broward, Brevard
     and St. Lucie Counties in Florida, portions of which are under lease to

     in Hialeah, Florida, that serves as the Florida Division's headquarters;
     another office facility in Rockledge, Florida, and various service centers


                                      12 <PAGE>


     in New Jersey and in Florida from which the Company dispatches service
     crews and conducts construction and maintenance activities. In addition,
     the Company owns working interests in certain gas production in New York
     State and holds minor working interests in gas properties in Louisiana.

          Elizabethtown leases approximately 160,000 square feet in an office
     building in Union, New Jersey, which serves as the New Jersey Division's
     headquarters. The building is owned and operated by the Liberty Hall Joint
     Venture. Participants in the joint venture are Cali Liberty Hall
     Associates, a New Jersey general partnership, and a Kean family trust, of
     which John Kean and Stewart Kean are trustees. John Kean and Stewart Kean
     beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of NUI Common
     Stock. All negotiations relative to the lease were conducted between
     Elizabethtown and Cali Liberty Hall Associates. No person involved with
     the Kean family trust participated in such discussions. The lease
     agreement is for an initial term through 2009 with two consecutive
     five-year renewal options. Elizabethtown also has the right of first
     refusal to purchase the building in the event the owner seeks to sell the
     property. The annual base rent is approximately $2.6 million in 1994,
     $2.9 million from 1995 through 1999, $3.3 million from 2000 through 2004
     and $3.7 million from 2005 through 2009.

          Subject to minor exceptions and encumbrances, all other units of
     property materially important to the Company and all principal plants are
     owned in fee, except that most of the mains and pipes are installed in
     public streets under franchise or statutory rights or are constructed on
     rights of way acquired from the apparent owner of the fee.

     Item 3. Legal Proceedings

          The Company is involved in various claims and litigation incidental
     to its business. In the opinion of management, none of these claims and
     litigation will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
     operations or its financial condition.

          Not applicable.

     Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
     Results of Operations 

          The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction
     with "Summary Consolidated Financial Data," "Summary Consolidated
     Operating Data" and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements,
     including the notes thereto.

     Overview

          Net income for fiscal 1993 was $16.0 million, as compared with net
     income of $16.5 million for fiscal 1992 and $9.1 million for fiscal 1991.
     The decrease in net income in fiscal 1993 as compared with fiscal 1992
     reflects the realization of certain investment gains in fiscal 1992 and
     higher interest expense in fiscal 1993, partly offset by higher volumes of
     gas sold or transported as a result of adding residential and commercial
     customers and increased demand by industrial customers. The increase in
     net income in fiscal 1992 as compared with fiscal 1991 reflects higher
     volumes of gas sold or transported as a result of adding residential and
     commercial customers, increased demand by industrial customers, increased
     heating demand as a result of cooler weather, margin effects from the
     implementation of higher rates in Florida and a weather normalization
     clause in New Jersey, and the realization of certain investment gains;
     partly offset by higher interest expense. 

     Results of Operations

          Operating Revenues and Operating Margin. The following summarizes the
     Company's revenues and operating margins for the past three fiscal years
     (in thousands):

                                             1991          1992         1993   
     Operating Revenues                    $291,320     $291,032     $354,889
     Purchased Gas and Fuel                (151,928)    (139,309)    (195,842)
     Gross Receipts and Franchise
     Taxes                                  (28,875)     (30,297)     (30,472)
                                             ------       ------       ------
     Operating Margins                     $110,517     $121,426     $128,575
                                             ======       ======       ======

          The Company's operating revenues increased by $63.9 million, or 22%,
     for fiscal 1993 as compared with fiscal 1992 and decreased by
     $0.3 million, or 0.1%, for fiscal 1992 as compared with fiscal 1991. This
     increase for fiscal 1993 as compared with fiscal 1992 principally reflects
     additional residential and commercial customers served and higher volumes
     sold or transported to industrial customers, as well as the effect of
     increased gas costs, partly offset by the effects of weather that was 2%
     warmer during the heating season (as measured in degree days). The effects
     on operating revenues for fiscal 1992 as compared with fiscal 1991 from
     adding residential and commercial customers and from a heating season that
     was 16% cooler were offset by the effects of shifts by industrial
     customers from sales service to transportation service and by lower gas
     costs. Gas cost adjustment clauses in both New Jersey and Florida enable
     the Company to pass through to customers, through periodic adjustments to
     the amounts billed, increased or decreased costs incurred by the Company
     for purchased gas, without affecting operating margins. Adjustments
     related to changes in gas costs had the net effect of increasing operating


                                      16 <PAGE>


     revenues by $12.4 million in fiscal 1993 and $4.4 million in fiscal 1991
     and reducing operating revenues by $16.0 million in fiscal 1992, with
     offsetting adjustments to purchased gas and fuel costs and to gross
     receipts and franchise taxes. Margin rates applicable to industrial
     transportation service are substantially the same as margin rates
     applicable to sales services for such customers.

          The Company's total operating margins in fiscal 1993 increased by
     $7.1 million, or 5.9%, as compared with fiscal 1992. The total number of
     customers served increased by 2,572 or 0.8%, as compared with fiscal 1992.
     In New Jersey, the number of heating customers served increased by 4,715,
     or 3.0%, as compared with fiscal 1992, including the effects of converting
     existing water heating and cooking service customers into gas-heating
     customers. The Company estimates that operating margins were lower by
     $0.5 million in fiscal 1993 because of losses suffered by its customers in
     August 1992 as a result of Hurricane Andrew, as approximately 2,000 of the
     customers previously served have not rebuilt, and may not rebuild, homes
     that were damaged in the storm.

          The Company's total operating margins in fiscal 1992 increased by
     $10.9 million, or 9.9%, as compared with fiscal 1991. The total number of
     customers served increased by 4,243 or 1.4%, as compared with fiscal 1991,
     and the number of heating customers served in New Jersey increased by
     4,829, or 3.1%, as compared with fiscal 1991, including the effects of
     converting existing water heating and cooking service customers into
     gas-heating customers. 

          Operating margins from industrial customers amounted to $13.6 million
     in fiscal 1993, $12.9 million in fiscal 1992 and $11.5 million in fiscal
     1991. The year-to-year increases principally reflect the inception of
     service in fiscal 1992 for a cogeneration facility in New Jersey and an
     industrial facility in Florida.

          Operating Income. The following summarizes elements of the Company's
     operating income for the past three fiscal years (in thousands):

                                            1991          1992          1993

          The Company's operating income before income taxes increased by $1.1
     million in fiscal 1993 as compared with fiscal 1992, principally
     reflecting the improvement in operating margins, partially offset by
     increased operation and maintenance expenses. In fiscal 1992, operating
     income before income taxes increased by $8.8 million as compared with
     fiscal 1991, principally reflecting the improvement in operating margins


                                      17 <PAGE>


     and the absence of certain non-recurring charges incurred in fiscal 1991
     in connection with a work stoppage at the New Jersey Division ($0.6
     million) and a write down of certain house piping costs at the Florida
     Division ($0.8 million). The work stoppage, which began upon the
     expiration of an existing labor contract, was resolved when agreement was
     reached with respect to the current four-year contract at the New Jersey
     Division commencing as of November 21, 1990. Operation and maintenance
     expenses increased by 7.5% in fiscal 1993 as compared with fiscal 1992
     and, excluding the non-recurring charges incurred in fiscal 1991, by 4.0%
     in fiscal 1992 as compared with fiscal 1991, principally reflecting system
     growth and, in fiscal 1993, management services previously borne by NUI.

          Other Income and Expense. Other income, net, for fiscal 1992 included
     realized net pretax gains on the sale of marketable securities amounting
     to $0.8 million. The write down of properties in fiscal 1991 relates to
     certain reserves of natural gas that are recoverable based upon market
     prices that had declined significantly. 

          Interest Expense. Interest expense increased in fiscal 1992 and 1993
     reflecting higher outstanding borrowings, partly offset by lower
     prevailing interest rates.

     Regulatory Matters

          The Company's current rates and tariffs reflect rate cases concluded
     in both New Jersey and Florida in 1991. In the New Jersey case, which was
     settled in October 1991, the Company obtained a weather normalization
     clause and reduced its rates by an amount equivalent to $500,000 in annual
     revenues. The weather normalization clause, which is designed to help
     stabilize the Company's results by increasing amounts charged to customers
     when weather has been warmer than normal and by decreasing amounts charged
     when weather has been colder than normal, was initially adopted on a
     two-year test basis and has been extended through fiscal 1994. Revenue
     adjustments pursuant to the weather normalization clause increased the
     Company's operating margins by $1.3 million in fiscal 1993 and by $0.8
     million in fiscal 1992. The New Jersey rate case settlement reflected a
     rate base amounting to approximately $184 million with an allowed overall
     return of 11.3%, which would allow the Company the opportunity to earn a
     12.4% return on New Jersey Division utility equity. In the Florida case,
     which was settled in August 1991, the Company increased its rates by an
     amount equivalent to $3.5 million in annual revenues. A portion of this
     increase, equivalent to $2.5 million annually, was being billed on an
     interim basis since July 1990. The Florida rate case settlement reflected
     a rate base amounting to approximately $63 million with an allowed overall
     return of 9.47%, which would allow the Company the opportunity to earn a
     13.0% return on Florida Division utility equity. 

          In November 1993, the NJBRC issued guidelines which are designed to
     provide for unbundling of natural gas transportation and sales services to
     commercial and industrial customers. Under these guidelines the Company is
     required to file new tariffs for its New Jersey Division by April 1, 1994.
     The Company expects the effect of the new tariffs to be neutral to the
     operating revenues and margins of the Company.

          In response to an initiative by the FPSC, several Florida natural gas
     utilities agreed in November 1993 to reduce the return allowed on their
     utility equity to either 11% or 11.25%. The Company expects to agree to a


                                      18 <PAGE>


     reduction in its allowed return on equity; however, it expects the allowed
     return, as adjusted, to exceed the return it is actually achieving.
     Therefore, the Company expects that the adjustment will not affect
     operating revenues and margins.

     Financing Activities and Resources

          Financing Resources. The Company generally funds its operations with
     internally generated cash, supplemented with borrowings under its bank
     lines of credit to satisfy seasonal requirements. The Company also borrows
     under its bank lines of credit to finance portions of its construction
     expenditures, pending refinancing through the issuance of equity or
     long-term indebtedness at a later date depending upon prevailing market
     conditions. The Company seeks to assure access to funds for system growth
     and integrity through timely issuances of additional equity capital by NUI
     or long-term debt at the lowest reasonable costs that provide fair returns
     to investors.

          Internally Generated Funds. Net cash provided by operating activities
     before changes in working capital was $44.2 million in fiscal 1993,
     $38.0 million in fiscal 1992 and $32.6 million in fiscal 1991. Working
     capital increased $42.1 million in fiscal 1993 and $23.1 million in fiscal
     1992, and decreased $8.0 million in fiscal 1991. The increases in net
     working capital in fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1992 principally reflect
     increased year end purchases of fuel supplies for the coming heating
     season and accelerated payments of gross receipts and franchise taxes
     under New Jersey law (see "-Capital Expenditures and Commitments"). This
     was partially offset by the realization of deferred taxes that had been
     established previously in connection with accruals of gross receipts and
     franchise taxes. The decrease in net working capital in fiscal 1991
     principally reflects lower fuel supplies acquired for inventory, partially
     offset by the effect of funding a litigation settlement. The level of fuel
     supplies at year end purchased in advance of peak heating season demand is
     dependent upon market conditions and system operating requirements.

          Long-Term Debt and Funds for Construction Held by Trustee. In October
     1991, pursuant to agreements with the New Jersey Economic Development
     Authority, the Company issued gas facilities revenue bonds that mature in
     October 2021 in the amount of $46.2 million at 6.75% and $8.4 million at
     6.625% to finance expenditures through fiscal 1995 for the construction of
     certain gas facilities and related equipment in New Jersey, including
     approximately $11.4 million expended prior to incurring this long-term
     debt. The unexpended portion of the net proceeds from these borrowings was
     $24.2 million at September 30, 1993, and is classified on the Company's
     consolidated balance sheet as funds for construction held by trustee until
     drawn upon incurring eligible expenditures.

          In fiscal 1992, in accordance with the optional prepayment provisions
     of the underlying indenture agreements, the Company borrowed under its
     bank lines of credit to repay $6.6 million of 6.5% sinking fund debentures
     and $6.1 million of 9.5% sinking fund debentures in advance of their
     scheduled maturities. 

          Short-Term Debt. The weighted average daily amounts outstanding of
     notes payable to banks and the weighted average interest rates on those
     amounts were $32.2 million at 3.6% in fiscal 1993, $13.0 million at 5.0%
     in fiscal 1992 and $16.0 million at 7.9% in fiscal 1991. At September 30,


                                      19 <PAGE>


     1993, the Company had outstanding notes payable to banks amounting to
     $63.2 million and available unused lines of credit amounting to
     $63.7 million.

          Common Stock and Dividends. NUI is Elizabethtown's sole shareholder.
     NUI contributed additional equity capital amounting to $10.0 million in
     fiscal 1993 and $6.5 million in fiscal 1991. Elizabethtown paid dividends
     to NUI amounting to $10.7 million in fiscal 1993 and $9.2 million in
     fiscal 1992 and 1991. 

     Capital Expenditures and Commitments 

          Capital expenditures, which consist primarily of expenditures to
     expand and upgrade the Company's gas distribution systems, were
     $39.6 million in fiscal 1993, $31.3 million in fiscal 1992 and
     $24.8 million in fiscal 1991. Approximately $58.6 million of these capital
     expenditures were for construction relating to new customers and
     additional distribution, storage and other gas plant facilities. The
     Company's capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $48.0
     million in fiscal 1994, including approximately $30.7 million for system
     expansion. In addition, the net present value of minimum lease payments
     relating to noncancelable operating leases, which relate principally to
     New Jersey Division office space, is approximately $23.0 million as of
     September 30, 1993, including $3.0 million payable in fiscal 1994.

          As discussed in "-Commitments and Contingencies," Note 8 of the Notes
     to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company expects it
     will expend in the next twenty years approximately $25 million to complete
     investigation and remediation of the contamination on New Jersey
     properties which the Company owns or previously owned on which gas was
     manufactured in the past. The ultimate costs will depend upon the
     investigation and remediation plans that finally are adopted by the
     Company, subject to the approval of the NJDEPE, and may be less or greater
     than the Company's current estimate. The Company believes the remediation
     costs will be recoverable in rates and that a portion of such costs may be
     recoverable from the Company's insurance carriers.

          In June 1991, legislation was enacted in New Jersey that accelerates
     the payments of approximately $30 million of gross receipts and franchise
     taxes by an average of almost one and a half years in stages from 1992
     through 1994. The Company expects that future base rate orders will
     reflect the recovery of prospective costs associated with the related
     additional financing requirements.

          Certain of the Company's long-term contracts for the supply, storage
     and delivery of natural gas include fixed charges that amount to
     approximately $64 million annually, of which approximately $43 million is
     associated with pipeline delivery contracts. The Company currently
     recovers, and expects to continue to recover, such fixed charges through
     its gas adjustment clauses. The Company also is committed to purchase, at
     market-related prices, minimum quantities of gas that, in the aggregate,
     are approximately 7 million Mcf per year or to pay certain costs in the
     event the minimum quantities are not taken. The Company expects that
     minimum demand on its systems will continue to exceed these minimum
     purchase obligations.




                                      20 <PAGE>


          The implementation of FERC Order No. 636 required the restructuring
     of the Company's contracts with certain pipeline companies that together
     supply less than one-third of the Company's total firm gas supply. Under
     Order No. 636 the pipeline companies are passing through to their
     customers transition costs associated with mandated restructuring, such as
     costs resulting from buying out unmarketable gas purchase contracts. The
     transition costs charged to the Company have amounted to approximately
     $1.4 million and are being recovered through the Company's gas adjustment
     clauses. 

          As of September 30, 1993, the scheduled repayments of the Company's
     long-term debt over the next five years were as follows: $1.9 million in
     fiscal 1994, $1.1 million in fiscal 1995, $1.1 million in fiscal 1996,
     $3.2 million in fiscal 1997 and $1.0 million in fiscal 1998. The gas
     facilities revenue bonds that are due in 2014 and the remaining balance of
     first mortgage bonds become eligible in fiscal 1994 for optional
     prepayment amounting to $1.3 million in excess of their $57.3 million face
     value.

          The Company's future capital expenditures and commitments will likely
     require additional debt and equity financing. 

     Pending Acquisition

          On July 27, 1993, NUI and PSGS entered into an Agreement and Plan of
     Merger, pursuant to which PSGS would be merged with and into NUI (the
     "PSGS Merger"). Under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, NUI will acquire
     all of the outstanding common shares of PSGS for approximately $17
     million, payable in shares of NUI Common Stock equivalent to $71.50 per
     PSGS share, except that each shareholder will receive no less than 2.4 and
     no more than 3.0 shares of NUI Common Stock for each PSGS share held. The
     exchange value of the NUI Common Stock will be established immediately
     prior to the merger. The PSGS Merger will be consummated upon receipt of
     all required regulatory approvals, the approval of the stockholders of
     PSGS, and the satisfaction or waiver of certain other consents and
     conditions. Upon the effectiveness of the PSGS Merger, NUI would assume
     all of the rights and obligations of PSGS. Following the PSGS Merger,
     Elizabethtown will be merged with and into NUI (the "Elizabethtown
     Merger"). 

          The PSGS Merger will be accounted for as a purchase of PSGS by NUI in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, due
     to the effects of the regulatory process, the underlying net assets of
     PSGS will become the assets of NUI at, generally, their historical net
     book value and the excess of the purchase price over the historical net
     book value of the underlying net assets of PSGS, which amounts to
     approximately $6.8 million, will be added to utility plant as a "utility
     plant acquisition adjustment," which will be amortized over a thirty-year
     period that approximates the remaining useful life of the utility plant
     acquired.

          Under its business plan, the Company concentrates on customer growth
     and the profitability of the gas distribution business. The PSGS Merger,
     which will result in a seven percent increase in the number of customers
     served, and the Elizabethtown Merger, through which NUI will become an
     operating utility company with three divisions providing gas service in
     six states, fit within the business plan. Further growth opportunities,


                                      21 <PAGE>


     which could include the acquisition of additional gas distribution
     companies, the development of new franchises and the management of certain
     service requirements of other utilities on a contract basis, will likely
     require additional debt and equity financing.

     Effects of Inflation

          The Company's tariffs provide gas cost adjustment clauses through
     which rates charged to customers are adjusted for changes in the cost of
     gas on a reasonably current basis. Increases in other utility costs and
     expenses not otherwise offset by increases in revenue could have an
     adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with the
     regulatory process and the relative uncertainty of whether the regulatory
     process will allow full recovery of such costs. The ratemaking process
     limits the recovery of utility plant costs to original cost and net cost
     of removal on the basis of approved depreciation rates. Replacement of
     long-lived utility plant assets is made at significantly higher current
     costs that should be recoverable through rates in future periods as such
     assets are depreciated.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

     To Elizabethtown Gas Company:

          We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
     statements of consolidated capitalization of Elizabethtown Gas Company (a
     New Jersey corporation) and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1993 and
     1992, and the related statements of consolidated income, cash flows, taxes
     and shareholder's equity, for each of the three years in the period ended
     September 30, 1993. These consolidated financial statements are the
     responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
     express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
     audits.
          
          We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
     auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
     audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
     financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
     disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also
     includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
     estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
     statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
     basis for our opinion.
          
          In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
     above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
     Elizabethtown Gas Company and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1993 and
     1992, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
     the three years in the period ended September 30, 1993, in conformity with
     generally accepted accounting principles.
          
          We have also audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing
     standards, the consolidated balance sheets and statements of consolidated
     capitalization as of September 30, 1991, 1990 and 1989, and the related
     consolidated statements of income, cash flows, taxes and shareholder's
     equity, for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 1990
     (none of which are presented herein), and have expressed an unqualified
     opinion on those financial statements. In our opinion, the information set
     forth in the summary consolidated financial data for each of the five
     years in the period ending September 30, 1993, appearing under the heading
     "Summary Consolidated Financial Data" is fairly stated in all material
     respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements from which
     it has been derived.
          
          Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
     basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed in Item
     14(a)(2) are presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
     Exchange Commission's rules and are not part of the basic financial
     statements. These schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures
     applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
     opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data required
     to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
     taken as a whole.

                      Elizabethtown Gas Company and Subsidiaries
                   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 


          1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
      
          Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements
     include the accounts of Elizabethtown Gas Company ("Elizabethtown") and
     its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Company"). Elizabethtown, which is a
     wholly-owned subsidiary of NUI Corporation ("NUI"), distributes natural
     gas in New Jersey and Florida. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
     been eliminated in consolidation. 

          Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial
     statements to conform with the current year presentation. 

          Regulation.The Company's operations are subject to regulation by the
     New Jersey Board of Regulatory Commissioners (the "NJBRC") and the Florida
     Public Service Commission (the "FPSC"). 

          Property, Plant and Equipment. Utility plant is stated at its
     original cost at the time it was placed into service. Depreciation is
     provided on a composite straight-line basis using rates approved by the
     state commissions. The estimated service lives used range from 5 to 84
     years. At the time properties are retired, the original cost plus the cost
     of retirement, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.
      
          The unamortized plant acquisition adjustment represents the remaining
     unamortized portion of the excess, at the date of acquisition of the
     Florida Division, of the purchase price over the book value of the net
     assets acquired. The plant acquisition adjustment is being amortized on a
     straight-line basis over thirty years. 

          Repairs of all property, plant and equipment and replacements and
     renewals of minor items of property are charged to maintenance expense as
     incurred. 

          Revenues and Gas and Fuel Costs. Operating revenues include accrued
     unbilled revenues through the end of each accounting period. Operating
     revenues also include adjustments attributable to the New Jersey
     Division's weather normalization clause that are accrued during the winter
     heating season and billed or credited to customers in the following year.
     Weather normalization adjustments increased the Company's operating
     margins (operating revenues less purchased gas and fuel and gross receipts
     and franchise taxes) by approximately $1.3 million in fiscal 1993 and $0.8
     million in fiscal 1992.

          Costs of gas and fuel are recognized as expenses in accordance with
     the gas cost adjustment clause applicable in each state. Such clauses
     provide for periodic reconciliations of actual recoverable gas costs and
     the estimated amounts that have been billed to customers. Under or over
     recoveries are deferred when they arise and are recovered from or refunded
     to customers in subsequent periods. 

          Income Taxes. The Company provides deferred Federal income taxes for
     differences between book and tax income other than taxes associated with a
     portion of the differences in depreciation of New Jersey Division utility


                                      F-9 <PAGE>


     plant additions prior to October 1, 1975 that, in accordance with a rate
     order, are being flowed through to customers. The net amount of such
     differences for which deferred income taxes have not been provided was
     approximately $8 million at September 30, 1993. Under the established
     ratemaking practices, taxes attributable to these differences for which
     deferred taxes were not previously provided are collected in customers'
     rates when due for payment.

          Investment tax credits, which were generated principally in
     connection with additions to utility plant made prior to January 1, 1986,
     are being amortized over the estimated service lives of the properties
     that gave rise to the credits.
      
          As of October 1, 1993, the Company will adopt Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
     which, among other things, changes the method used by enterprises to
     account for deferred income taxes. Accordingly, the Company will record
     deferred income taxes not previously provided for the differences between
     the book and tax bases of assets, and will adjust previously established
     deferred income taxes to reflect the currently expected Federal income tax
     rate. Adoption of SFAS No. 109 will not have a material effect on the
     Company's net income because, as discussed above, deferred taxes
     previously not provided will be collected from customers as the taxes are
     paid and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect the current
     Federal income tax rate generally will be included in operating income
     over the remaining depreciable lives of the related property in accordance
     with the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and the Company's
     revenue requirements for ratemaking purposes will be reduced concurrently.
     As of October 1, 1993, the Company will increase the deferred tax
     liability by approximately $9.0 million, increase the unamortized plant
     acquisition adjustment by approximately $9.2 million and record a net
     regulatory liability of approximately $0.2 million.

          Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The Company provides
     certain health care benefits to substantially all retirees receiving
     benefits under a Company pension plan, other than the Florida Division
     plan, who reach retirement age while working for the Company. The cost of
     these benefits, which is expensed as claims are incurred, was $0.7 million
     in fiscal 1993, $0.6 million in fiscal 1992 and $0.8 million in fiscal
     1991.

          As of October 1, 1993, the Company will adopt the accounting method
     required by SFAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
     Benefits Other Than Pensions," which, among other things, requires
     enterprises to accrue the expected cost of these benefits during the years
     that eligible employees render the necessary service. The adoption of SFAS
     No. 106 will give rise to an unfunded postretirement benefit obligation
     amounting to $21 million. The Company has received an order from the NJBRC
     permitting it to defer for as long as five years the difference between
     the amount of expense computed as claims are incurred and the amount
     computed on the accrual method, pending ratemaking treatment that would be
     considered in a full rate case. The consensus issued in 1993 by the
     Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
     (the "EITF") permits rate regulated companies to defer such expenses when
     the ratemaking treatment provides for them to be fully recovered in the
     subsequent fifteen year period. The Company expects to seek ratemaking
     treatment that is consistent with the EITF's consensus and, accordingly,


                                     F-10 <PAGE>


     the adoption of SFAS No. 106 is not expected to have a material effect
     upon the Company's net income.

          The Company continually evaluates alternative ways to manage these
     benefits and control their costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions to
     assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a
     significant effect on the amount of the reported obligation and the annual
     deferrals and expense.

          2. Pending Acquisition

          On July 27, 1993, NUI and Pennsylvania & Southern Gas Company
     ("PSGS") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to which
     PSGS would be merged with and into NUI (the "PSGS Merger"). Under the
     Agreement and Plan of Merger, NUI will acquire all of the outstanding
     common shares of PSGS for approximately $17 million, payable in shares of
     NUI Common Stock equivalent to $71.50 per PSGS share, except that each
     shareholder will receive no less than 2.4 and no more than 3.0 shares of
     NUI Common Stock for each PSGS share held. The exchange value of the NUI
     Common Stock will be established immediately prior to the merger. The PSGS
     Merger will be consummated upon receipt of all required regulatory
     approvals, the approval of the stockholders of PSGS, and the satisfaction
     or waiver of certain other consents and conditions. Upon the effectiveness
     of the PSGS Merger, NUI would assume all of the rights and obligations of
     PSGS. Following the PSGS Merger, Elizabethtown will be merged with and
     into NUI (the "Elizabethtown Merger"). 

          The PSGS Merger will be accounted for as a purchase of PSGS by NUI in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, due
     to the effects of the regulatory process, the underlying net assets of
     PSGS will become the assets of NUI at, generally, their historical net
     book value and the excess of the purchase price over the historical net
     book value of the underlying net assets of PSGS, which amounts to
     approximately $6.8 million, will be added to utility plant as a "utility
     plant acquisition adjustment," which will be amortized over a thirty-year
     period that approximates the remaining useful life of the utility plant
     acquired.

          Under its business plan, the Company concentrates on customer growth
     and the profitability of the gas distribution business. The PSGS Merger,
     which will result in a seven percent increase in the number of customers
     served, and the Elizabethtown Merger, through which NUI will become an
     operating utility company with three divisions providing gas service in
     six states, fit within the business plan.

          3. Capitalization
      
          Long-Term Debt. In October 1991, pursuant to agreements between
     Elizabethtown and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, gas
     facilities revenue bonds that mature in October 2021 were issued in the
     amount of $46.2 million at 6.75% and $8.4 million at 6.625% to finance
     expenditures through fiscal 1995 for the construction of certain gas
     facilities and related equipment in New Jersey, including approximately
     $11.4 million expended prior to incurring this long-term debt. The
     unexpended portion of the net proceeds from these borrowings was
     $24.2 million at September 30, 1993 and is classified on the Company's



                                     F-11 <PAGE>


     consolidated balance sheet as funds for construction held by trustee until
     drawn upon incurring eligible expenditures.

          In fiscal 1992, in accordance with the optional prepayment provisions
     of the underlying indenture agreements, Elizabethtown borrowed under its
     bank lines of credit to repay $6.6 million of 6.5% sinking fund debentures
     and $6.1 million of 9.5% sinking fund debentures in advance of their
     scheduled maturities.

          The Florida Division's assets collateralize a mortgage and deed of
     trust, dated November 1, 1959, and subsequent modifications thereof. 

          As of September 30, 1993, the scheduled repayments of the Company's
     long-term debt over the next five years were as follows: $1.9 million in
     fiscal 1994, $1.1 million in fiscal 1995, $1.1 million in fiscal 1996,
     $3.2 million in fiscal 1997 and $1.0 million in fiscal 1998. The gas
     facilities revenue bonds that are due in 2014 and the remaining balance of
     first mortgage bonds become eligible in fiscal 1994 for optional
     prepayment amounting to $1.3 million in excess of their $57.3 million face
     value.

          Preferred Stock. Elizabethtown has 500,000 shares of authorized but
     unissued preferred stock.

          Common Stock. NUI contributed additional equity capital amounting to
     $10.0 million in fiscal 1993 and $6.5 million in fiscal 1991.

          Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The Company provides an employee stock
     ownership plan for certain employees of its Florida Division (the "ESOP"),
     which was funded initially with indebtedness that is guaranteed by a
     subsidiary of Elizabethtown. The Company incurred ESOP contribution
     expense amounting to $0.9 million in fiscal 1993, $0.7 million in fiscal
     1992 and $1.0 million in fiscal 1991, representing contributions for loan
     payments and to acquire additional shares of NUI Common Stock. As of
     September 30, 1993, the ESOP trust held 263,103 shares of NUI Common
     Stock, of which 179,493 shares were allocated to participating employees.
     Participating employees are entitled to vote the allocated shares and the
     ESOP trustees vote the remainder of the shares.

          4. Notes Payable to Banks

          At September 30, 1993, the Company's outstanding notes payable to
     banks were $63.2 million with a combined weighted average interest rate of
     3.8%. Unused lines of credit at September 30, 1993 were $63.7 million.
     While there are no formal compensating balance requirements, certain banks
     have indicated that satisfactory balances should be maintained to support
     the lines of credit and services provided.
      
          The weighted average daily amount outstanding of notes payable to
     banks and the weighted average interest rate on that amount was
     $32.2 million at 3.6% in fiscal 1993, $13.0 million at 5.0% in fiscal 1992
     and $16.0 million at 7.9% in fiscal 1991.

          5. Leases

          Property, plant and equipment held under capital leases amounted to
     $22.0 million at September 30, 1993 and $22.4 million at September 30,


                                     F-12 <PAGE>


     1992, with related accumulated amortization of $8.0 million in 1993 and
     $7.0 million in 1992. These properties consisted principally of leasehold
     improvements and office furniture and fixtures for a divisional
     headquarters. A summary of future minimum payments for properties held
     under capital leases follows (in thousands):

          Minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases, which relate
     principally to office space for a divisional headquarters, are
     approximately $3.0 million in each of the next five years.

          Rents charged to operating expenses were $4.0 million in fiscal 1993,
     $3.7 million in fiscal 1992 and $3.6 million in fiscal 1991.

          6. Other Income and Expense

          The write down of properties in fiscal 1991 relates to certain
     reserves of natural gas that are recoverable based upon market prices that
     had declined significantly. 

          7. Pension Benefits

          The Company has non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans
     which cover substantially all of its employees, other than the Florida
     Division's unionized employees who participate in a union sponsored
     multi-employer plan. The Company funds its plans in accordance with the
     requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
     (ERISA) and makes contributions to the union sponsored plan in accordance
     with its contractual obligations. Benefits paid under the Company's plans
     are based on years of service and levels of compensation. The Company's
     actuarial calculation of pension expense is based on the projected unit
     cost method.

          The projected benefit obligation for the Company's principal pension
     plan was calculated using a discount rate of 7% in fiscal 1993 and 8.25%
     in fiscal 1992 and an assumed annual increase in compensation levels of 5%
     in fiscal 1993 and 5.25% in fiscal 1992. The expected long-term rate of
     return on assets is 9%. The assets of the Company's funded plans are
     invested primarily in publicly-traded fixed income and equity securities. 

          Certain key employees also participate in an unfunded supplemental
     retirement plan. The projected benefit obligation under this plan was
     $3.1 million as of September 30, 1993 and $1.8 million as of September 30,
     1992, and the expense for this plan is approximately $0.4 million
     annually.

          8. Commitments and Contingencies

          Commitments. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately
     $48.0 million in fiscal 1994. 

          Environmental Matters. The Company is subject to federal and state
     legislation with respect to water, air quality, solid waste disposal and
     employee health and safety matters and to environmental regulations issued
     by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), the New


                                     F-14 <PAGE>


     Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy (the "NJDEPE"),
     and other federal and state agencies.

          The Company owns, or previously owned, certain properties on which
     gas was manufactured by the New Jersey Division or by other parties in the
     past. Coal tar residues are present on six of these sites and the Company
     has reported their presence to the EPA, the NJDEPE and the NJBRC. In April
     1991, the NJDEPE issued an Administrative Consent Order that establishes
     the procedures to be followed by the Company in the development of its
     remediation plan for the site on South Street in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
     Subsequently, the Company and the NJDEPE entered into Memoranda of
     Agreement that establish procedures for the development of investigation
     and remediation plans for the other five sites.

          The Company expects it will expend in the next twenty years
     approximately $25 million, net of approximately $6 million that the
     Company estimates will be borne by the prior owner and operator of certain
     of the sites, to complete investigation of such sites and the remediation
     of the coal tar contamination. The Company, with the assistance of an
     outside consulting firm, determined the estimated expenditure by assessing
     the cost of (1) obtaining additional required data about each site and (2)
     the applicable remedial action, among those currently known, that is most
     appropriate for each site. The ultimate costs will depend upon the
     investigation and remediation plans that finally are adopted by the
     Company, subject to the approval of the NJDEPE, and may be less or greater
     than the Company's current estimate. The Company has an accrual of
     approximately $25 million for investigation and remediation of the sites
     and the related costs have been deferred on its Consolidated Balance
     Sheet.

          The Company believes that its remediation costs will be recoverable
     in rates and that a portion of such costs may be recoverable from the
     Company's insurance carriers. The current base rate order for the New
     Jersey Division permits the Company to utilize full deferred accounting
     for coal tar related expenditures, which amounted to approximately $0.8
     million in fiscal 1993 and $0.6 million in fiscal 1992. The current base
     rate order provides for the recovery through rates at $130,000 annually of
     coal tar related expenditures incurred prior to the rate order. Other New
     Jersey utilities also have received authorization to recover similar
     environmental expenditures in rates.

          Gas Procurement Contracts. Certain of the Company's long-term
     contracts for the supply, storage and delivery of natural gas include
     fixed charges that amount to approximately $64 million annually, of which
     approximately $43 million is associated with pipeline delivery contracts.
     The Company currently recovers, and expects to continue to recover, such
     fixed charges through its gas adjustment clauses. The Company also is
     committed to purchase, at market-related prices, minimum quantities of gas
     that, in the aggregate, are approximately 7 million Mcf per year or to pay
     certain costs in the event the minimum quantities are not taken. The
     Company expects that minimum demand on its systems will continue to exceed
     these minimum purchase obligations.

          The implementation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC")
     Order No. 636 required the restructuring of the Company's contracts with
     certain pipeline companies that together supply less than one-third of the
     Company's total firm gas supply. Under Order No. 636 the pipeline


                                     F-15 <PAGE>


     companies are passing through to their customers transition costs
     associated with mandated restructuring, such as costs resulting from
     buying out unmarketable gas purchase contracts. The transition costs
     charged to the Company have amounted to approximately $1.4 million and are
     being recovered through the Company's gas adjustment clauses.

          Additionally, certain of the Company's suppliers received FERC
     approval of surcharges on their rates to recover costs incurred to settle
     certain take-or-pay obligations they had with natural gas producers. The
     New Jersey Division has received approval from the NJBRC to recover that
     portion of the surcharge that is based on a unit rate in the same manner
     as it recovers other commodity costs and to recover fixed charges over a
     nine-year period, ending in 1997. Of these fixed charges, the amount
     deferred as of September 30, 1993 was $2.0 million.

          Other. In addition, the Company is involved in various claims and
     litigation incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, none
     of these claims and litigation will have a material adverse effect on the
     Company's results of operations or its financial condition.
