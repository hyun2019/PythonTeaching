In March, 1994, the Company agreed to amend borrowing
arrangements with its bank lenders.  The new structure is a $35
million line of credit with interest payable quarterly at the
prime rate or at LIBOR plus a margin of 1% to 1.75%, depending on
the Company's debt to equity ratio.  The line of credit will
mature in four years and may be extended to five years by the
bank lenders.  The line of credit will be consummated once final
legal documentation is completed which is anticipated to be in
April, 1994.  Such facility will increase the Company's borrowing
capacity and, in the current interest rate environment, should
reduce the interest rate which the Company pays on its debt. 
Since the interest rate is a floating rate, the Company has no
guarantee that such reduction will be a permanent one.
